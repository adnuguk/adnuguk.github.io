Aberdeen Developers have been asked to promote the following job vacancy. If you are interested in the position, or would like some more information, then please contact [Solution Recruitment](mailto:recruitment@solab.co.uk).  The full job description can be found in the Word document attached to this post.


<blockquote>**About Solutions**

Solutions are one of the longest established IT support providers in Scotland. Based in Aberdeen, we have been supporting, training, developing and connecting businesses for over 21 years. We have a dedicated team of talented .Net developers, who design and implement bespoke web applications across many business sectors including oil and gas. We deliver high-value, measurable results by working collaboratively with clients using agile methodology.

Onboard is a SaaS based web application which provides an integrated approach to managing people, assets, projects, certification, training and competency in a collaborative online portal and is currently used in the UK sector, Brazil, Sakhalin Island, Africa, USA and Norway. The team aims to make Onboard the number one choice for energy service companies worldwide.

**Role**

Working as an agile business analyst for Solutions is an exciting and varied role. As well as working with a variety of clients on simultaneous projects, you will also be actively involved in managing the strategic direction of the application set. Although the role is primarily based in our Aberdeen office there is the opportunity to travel to meet clients and occasionally work from home.

You will liaise with clients, assume ownership of product backlogs, write user stories and acceptance criteria, define sprint objectives and own the sprint. You will be a leader and a real self-starter who is highly motivated and has a passion for technology and innovation. This is a new role created as a result of the successful growth of both Solutions and Onboard.
