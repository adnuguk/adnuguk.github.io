# Slides and Code from Glimpse Talk

I am still waiting to hear back from Anthony about where to find the Slides and Code for his presentation.  Once I hear back, I will update this post.

# Slides and Code from Azure Web Sites Talk

You can find the Slides and Code that Nik presented [here][Nik_GitHub_Page].  If you want to get in touch with Nik, you can use his twitter account [@nikmd23][Nik_Twitter_Account]

# Prizes

For everyone who was lucky enough to win a prize from one of our [sponsors][sponsors_page], I have requested all of the prizes.  If you haven't heard anything, please get in touch, and I will try to sort this out.
