<p>Modern Web Development with a Glimpse into ASP.NET</p>

<p>With the state of diagnostics on the web being what it is, we currently have to do a job that is much harder than it should be. Too often, the tools we are provided with only show a small part of the picture, leaving us to guess what else might be happening behind the scenes. Glimpse is an open source project that aims to change the way we think about diagnostics and the frameworks we interact with.</p>

<p>After releasing Glimpse at Mix 11, Glimpse has become a tool that is used daily by tens of thousands of developers around the world. In this session, youíll learn how to use Glimpse to reveal a complete picture of what is happening within your ASP.NET MVC and WebForms sites, discover what tools are included out of the box, and see how you can easily extend it to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Azure Web Sites Secrets, Exposed</p>

<p>Microsoft’s premier cloud solution for custom web applications, Windows Azure Web Sites, has brought the DevOps movement to millions of developers and revolutionized the way that servers are provisioned and applications deployed.</p>

<p>Included with all the headline functionality are many smaller, less-known or undocumented features that serve to greatly improve developer productivity. Join Microsoft MVP and veteran web developer Nik Molnar for a whirlwind tour of these secret features and enhance your cloud development experience.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Max Vasilyev on Thursday 17th November 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2>From zero to 1000 tests in 6 months</h2>

<p>Not every team in the industry is writing automated tests. And it is very difficult to convince everyone on the team and especially business people, that tests must be written.
That initial leap from no tests to some test is the most difficult and many people give up on that stage.</p>

<p>I would like to talk how we managed to jump that gap and started to write tests in our every-day process.
Topics discussed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ADD: Annoyance Driven Development</p></li>
<li><p>Isolation Frameworks</p></li>
<li><p>Dependency Injection</p></li>
<li><p>Automocking container</p></li>
<li><p>continuous Integration</p></li>
<li><p>Reflection in tests</p></li>
<li><p>Unit or no unit test?</p></li>
<li><p>Books review</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>

<p>Max Vasilyev is Senior Developer and QA Manager is Solutions Aberdeen. He have been working with .Net for the last 3 years and before that he worked as a developer in SQL Server.
In the past year he increased his interest in automated testing of the software, as he got very frustrated with constant bugs and shady coding techniques.
So the last year was a constant uphill battle with the business to improve coding quality and increase code test coverage.</p>

<p>The battle is not won yet, but now business agrees that tests are important and any team using Agile must have tests.</p>

<h2>Agenda – Thursday, 21st October 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>1800 - 1815: Arrival and registration</p></li>
<li><p>1815 - 1820: Introduction</p></li>
<li><p>1820 - 2000: From zero to 1000 tests in 6 months</p></li>
<li><p>2000 onwards: Questions and drinks at the bar</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Get your tickets now!</h1>

<p>I wanted to let you know about an upcoming event in Aberdeen that I have been helping to arrange. It is taking place on Friday 18th October 2013.  The event in question is the Northern Lights 2013 Conference.  The website for the conference can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/">http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/</a></p>

<p>The event is in its third year, and this year the theme is tools.  Both the tools that we use, and the tools we build.  There is a wide range of speakers available, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/hadi-hariri.html">Hadi Hariri</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/kendall-miller.html">Kendall Miller</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/24/sarah-drummond.html">Sarah Drummond</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/kate-stone.html">Kate Stone</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/10/02/maria-gutierrez.html">Maria Gutierrez</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/niall-merrigan.html">Niall Merrigan</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/glenn-henriksen.html">Glenn Hendriksen</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Who are offering up an exciting line up of talks.</p>

<p>In addition, there will be two open spaces at the conference, where attendees will have an opportunity to suggest a topic for an interactive conversation with other attendees and speakers.  If you haven’t been to an open space before, they are fantastic.  It is a perfect opportunity to interact with other like mind people about a topic that you are interested in.  The best way to get something out of this is to suggest a topic that you are especially interested in, and hopefully other people will get involved as well.</p>

<p>Tickets are £15 for the day, which includes coffee and lunch for regular attendees, and Students tickets to the talks are free, plus you can buy a lunch ticket for £5.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there.  If you have any questions about the event, then please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me.</p>

<p>If you know anyone else who would be interested in attending this event, I would really appreciate it if you could forward on this email.</p>

<h2>Introducing Agile to the Enterprise</h2>

<p><strong>Still Living in a Waterfall World? You&rsquo;re Not Alone!</strong> Convincing your company to use an Agile development approach for application development can be surprisingly difficult. While the initial benefits excite everyone, that enthusiasm often disappears when the true trade-offs of Agile become apparent. You may even find that many members of the development team aren&rsquo;t willing to give up their waterfall patterns of development. How do you convince the business that good software doesn&rsquo;t begin and end with a giant Microsoft Project Plan? In this session we&rsquo;ll discuss how you can get your company moving down the path to more effective software development and bridge the gap between traditional practices and the current software development landscape</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>How to discuss Agile with the Business:</strong> It&rsquo;s their money, you need to make sure they&rsquo;re on board with how you&rsquo;re going to spend it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Convincing the Team to Work Differently:</strong> Without the right patterns of development within your team, your first Agile project may be the last for a while.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Useful Compromises:</strong> When you can&rsquo;t change the world overnight, how do you at least get the ship turning in the right direction?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Presented by one of the founders of Gibraltar Software, we&rsquo;ll discuss how we&rsquo;ve worked with many enterprise customers to marry agile practices into traditional teams. Sometimes successful sometimes a brilliant failure - come and learn from our mistakes so you can produce better results and have happier customers and team members. We won&rsquo;t be focusing on a specific technology or Agile approach but rather how you get businesses to accept giving up the Gantt chart and learn to love software development.</p>

<h2>Building WPF and Silverlight Applications with Prism</h2>

<p>Taken from Microsoft&rsquo;s Prism page on CodePlex:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Prism provides guidance designed to help you more easily design and build rich, flexible, and easy-to-maintain Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop applications, Silverlight Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), and Windows Phone 7 applications.</em></p>

<p><em>Using design patterns that embody important architectural design principles, such as separation of concerns and loose coupling, Prism helps you to design and build applications using loosely coupled components that can evolve independently but that can be easily and seamlessly integrated into the overall application. These types of applications are known as composite applications.&ldquo;</em></p>

<p>In this talk, Martin will talk about his experience using Prism for building applications for the WPF 4 and Silverlight 5 platforms. He will show you how Prism can help you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Modularise your application</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MVVM effectively</p></li>
<li><p>Create flexible user interfaces</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate between components using loosely coupled events (publish/subscribe)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>

<p>Martin leads a small team of software developers at Genesis, delivering specialised engineering software tools for clients as well as internal LOB solutions. He started as a software developer in 1996, and has been developing for the .NET platform since its introduction in 2002. He has focused on native applications since the introduction of XAML to the Microsoft stack, and is never happier than when he has Visual Studio open on one monitor and Blend open on the other.</p>

<p>Martin lives in the shire with his wife and daughter, and can be seen playing guitar with his band &ldquo;Fusion&rdquo; at various weddings and events across the north-east of Scotland.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Jon Skeet on Thursday 8th August 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2>Abusing C</h2>

<p>As a purely amateur C# developer, code that I write rarely gets to hurt people. (Well, open source projects aside.) As such, it&rsquo;s fun to stretch the language a bit, find its limits&hellip; and then try to sneak past them. One of my first reactions to a new language feature is &ldquo;How can I use that for a completely different purpose to the intended one?&rdquo; The results are rarely pretty, but they&rsquo;re lots of fun.</p>

<p>The chances of any of the code you see in this session being even remotely useful to a conscientious developer are very slim. You may well learn some interesting things about the C# language, but that&rsquo;s a different matter. To put it another way: if you&rsquo;re trying to persuade your boss that it&rsquo;s important to send you for educational reasons, you probably don&rsquo;t want to show him this abstract.</p>

<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>

<p>Jon Skeet is a Java developer for Google in London, but he plays with C# (somewhat obsessively) in his free time.</p>

<p>He loves writing and talking about C#, and the third edition of &ldquo;C# in Depth&rdquo; was published earlier this year. Writing less formally, Jon spends a lot of time on Stack Overflow&hellip; where &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; is an understatement. Give him a puzzle about how C# behaves which gets him reaching for the language specification, and Jon is a happy bunny. Jon lives in Reading with his wife and three children.</p>
