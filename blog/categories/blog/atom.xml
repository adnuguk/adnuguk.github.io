<p><strong>Command Query Responsibility Segregation</strong></p>

<p>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) have been around for a while and many people called and used this architecture/pattern differently. Probably many of you have read many articles about this approach, but never actually got to do it on practice.</p>

<p>In this session there will be a brief theoretical discussion followed by practical examples with code samples and discussion of benefits of this approach.</p>

<p><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong></p>

<p>Manually delivery software can be a time consuming and error prone affair. Why have a valuable person sit and manually do this? They&rsquo;re bored, and as a result they&rsquo;re not paying full attention and mistakes happen. It isn&rsquo;t repeatable so all those deployments to the testing environment count for nothing when it all goes horribly wrong when deploying to the production environment. There must be a better way of delivering software.</p>

<p>There is!</p>

<p>Amazon reportedly deploys to production every few seconds, GitHub do it several times a day. What makes this possible is a continuous delivery pipeline - a set of processes and a culture of development that ensure that get you to the point where every commit to your source repository is a potential for production system.</p>

<p>Continuous Delivery aims to remove the issues with building, testing and ultimately deploying to production in a safe, repeatable, well tested and highly confident way. I aim to show you how to get started on this journey. It isn&rsquo;t as daunting as it first looks.</p>

<p><strong>Windows 10 and the Universal Windows App Platform</strong></p>

<p>Windows 10 is a big release for Microsoft. Commodious. Huge. Massive. Colossal. Humongous. ;-)</p>

<p>It’s the end of a journey to unify Windows. It’s the beginning of a journey for developers who want to take advantage of a universal app platform available across all Windows devices.</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll dig into what’s changed in Windows 10 for the Windows app developer. We’ll talk about the Universal App Platform that makes it possible to build code that runs on all Windows devices and about the Extension platforms for code that targets specific device families.</p>

<p>We’ll stay in Visual Studio as much as is possible and we’ll lean towards C# and XAML.</p>

<p><strong>Docker Strangelove - ASP.NET 5 on Linux</strong></p>

<p>Come and learn all about hacking on ASP.NET on Linux!</p>

<p>Linux is now an officially supported platform for ASP.NET applications and you can use epic open-source things like Docker to manage your deployments.</p>

<p>In this session Mark will show us how to run an ASP.NET 5 application on Linux, then in Docker on Linux, and a whole lot more going as far down the rabbit hole as time allows. There may even be time to set up a mini-cloud-within-a-cloud with automated deployments from GitHub!</p>
