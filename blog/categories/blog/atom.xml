<p><strong>Windows 10 and the Universal Windows App Platform</strong></p>

<p>Windows 10 is a big release for Microsoft. Commodious. Huge. Massive. Colossal. Humongous. ;-)</p>

<p>It’s the end of a journey to unify Windows. It’s the beginning of a journey for developers who want to take advantage of a universal app platform available across all Windows devices.</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll dig into what’s changed in Windows 10 for the Windows app developer. We’ll talk about the Universal App Platform that makes it possible to build code that runs on all Windows devices and about the Extension platforms for code that targets specific device families.</p>

<p>We’ll stay in Visual Studio as much as is possible and we’ll lean towards C# and XAML.</p>

<p><strong>Docker Strangelove - ASP.NET 5 on Linux</strong></p>

<p>Come and learn all about hacking on ASP.NET on Linux!</p>

<p>Linux is now an officially supported platform for ASP.NET applications and you can use epic open-source things like Docker to manage your deployments.</p>

<p>In this session Mark will show us how to run an ASP.NET 5 application on Linux, then in Docker on Linux, and a whole lot more going as far down the rabbit hole as time allows. There may even be time to set up a mini-cloud-within-a-cloud with automated deployments from GitHub!</p>

Mark has been a Windows Azure Development MVP for three years.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present the final night of Matt Ellis’s Scottish Tour. Join us on Thursday 23rd July 2015 at the Robert Gordon University to learn more about Microsoft’s recent move to open-source .NET!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>.NETCore Blimey!</strong></p>

<p>Microsoft have done the unthinkable and open-sourced .net, making it available on GitHub, and even taking it cross-platform. This is great news for developers, but do you know your .NET Core from your .Net Framework? Can you tell your CoreCLR from your CoreFX? And where does asp.net vnext and DNX come into this story? In this session, we’ll take a look at the big picture, dive deeply into some of the more interesting details and see how the pieces of Microsoft’s new .Net stack fit together, what it means for developers and find out exactly how you do run an .exe on Unix.</p>

<p><strong>Getting a helping hand from the Telerik Kendo UI and Reports</strong></p>

<p>With a new project based on heavy data entry and manipulation combined with getting to grips with new tech some help was required. I turned to using the Telerik tools in my ASP.NET MVC website. It simplified the data entry and the presentation of data and thus left lots of time to fight with CSS styling instead.</p>

<p>At the start I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was getting and even if it was going to be of use. It looked pretty in the Telerik demos but how complex was it really? In the presentation I want to share some of the knowledge I gained to give a simple view on how the Telerik Kendo UI and the Telerik reports slot into the ASP.MVC environment. Hopefully you can gain enough information to decide if it will benefit your projects or not.</p>
