<p><strong>Semantic Versioning with GitVersion</strong></p>

<p>Have you ever needed to control the version number of your application? If so, you will know that this isn’t something that you “get for free”. It’s hard! You may have tried to use some form of auto incrementing number from your Continuous Integration Server, or store a text file in source control and update it each time the build happens. Both of these approaches will work, but they don’t account for more complicated scenarios where you are working on multiple releases at the same time, or you want to use multiple Continuous Integration Servers. In this session, we will look at how we can improve the versioning of your application using a combination of branching strategies (either Gitflow or Githubflow) and an open source tool called GitVersion. GitVersion is a tool which allows you to easy generate the Semantic Version number for your application, based on the current state of your code base in it’s Git Repository.</p>

<p><strong>Command Query Responsibility Segregation</strong></p>

<p>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) have been around for a while and many people called and used this architecture/pattern differently. Probably many of you have read many articles about this approach, but never actually got to do it on practice.</p>

<p>In this session there will be a brief theoretical discussion followed by practical examples with code samples and discussion of benefits of this approach.</p>

<p><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong></p>

<p>Manually delivery software can be a time consuming and error prone affair. Why have a valuable person sit and manually do this? They&rsquo;re bored, and as a result they&rsquo;re not paying full attention and mistakes happen. It isn&rsquo;t repeatable so all those deployments to the testing environment count for nothing when it all goes horribly wrong when deploying to the production environment. There must be a better way of delivering software.</p>

<p>There is!</p>

<p>Amazon reportedly deploys to production every few seconds, GitHub do it several times a day. What makes this possible is a continuous delivery pipeline - a set of processes and a culture of development that ensure that get you to the point where every commit to your source repository is a potential for production system.</p>

<p>Continuous Delivery aims to remove the issues with building, testing and ultimately deploying to production in a safe, repeatable, well tested and highly confident way. I aim to show you how to get started on this journey. It isn&rsquo;t as daunting as it first looks.</p>
