        <title>Microsoft Exams</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Those who have been trying to book Microsoft Exams in recent months will be fully aware of the lack of local test centres in Aberdeen.  Unfortunately, there still appears to be a lack of any long term commitment for any new test centres, but Aberdeen Developers have been informed that there is some availability at a private session that has been organised at Aberdeen College on 27th November at 9am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen College are a Pearson Vue partner who don’t normally offer certification externally but Andrew at Motion Software has managed to arrange the use of this test centre for his team. He has kindly offered the remaining spaces to our members for a small fee (£5-£10) over the standard exam cost. Anyone looking to sit any Microsoft Exams should contact Andrew via his email [andrew]&amp;lsquo;at&amp;rsquo;[motionsoftware]&amp;lsquo;dot&amp;rsquo;[co]&amp;lsquo;dot&amp;rsquo;[uk] for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quick Survey - Aberdeen Testing Centre</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers have been approached by a local software development company who are keen to gauge the number of people that would welcome an Aberdeen test centre for Microsoft and Cisco exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the nearest test centres are in Edinburgh, Stirling or Glasgow. They would be very grateful if you could take a moment to answer a couple of quick questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to capture the answers to these questions in a Survey Monkey questionnaire, so if you could take the time to click on this link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MFVNDWZ&quot;&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MFVNDWZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And answer the two short questions, I would be really grateful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Your responses will be confidential with only numbers being shared with a potential test centre to assist them in their quest to be able to provide Microsoft and Cisco exams.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Upcoming BCS Talk - Daniel Russel</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Teaching 150K+ students at a time: The PowerSearchingWithGoogle.com story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to let you know about an upcoming talk that is being hosted by BCS Aberdeen, which I thought might interest you.  The talk is entitled ****, by Daniel Russell - Senior Research Scientist at Google:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have become incredibly popular in just the past 12 months. Many MOOCs have had more that 100K students register for their courses. Is this the future of online education? Or is it yet-another passing fancy in the educational technology parade? In the past 12 months we have run three MOOCs with more than 280K registrants. I&#8217;ll talk about what MOOCs are, how they&#8217;re actually run, the social community of learners that are essential for making MOOCs succeed, and what seems to work (and not work) in MOOCs. Along the way, I&#8217;ll talk a bit about how people seem to actually learn how to search&#8230; and do sensemaking as a task. I&#8217;ll also show evidence that behaviors learned in the MOOC persist after the end of class. %}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in attending this event, full details can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://aberdeen.bcs.org/events.php&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Room N311, RGU, Riverside East Building, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;About the speaker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Russell is the Uber Tech Lead for Search Quality and User Happiness in Mountain View. He earned his PhD in computer science, specializing in artificial intelligence until he realized that magnifying and understanding human intelligence was his real passion. Twenty years ago he foreswore AI in favor of HI, and enjoys teaching, learning, running and music, preferably all in one day. He worked at Xerox PARC before it was PARC.com, and was in the Advanced Technology Group at Apple, where he wrote the first 100 web pages for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com&quot;&gt;www.apple.com&lt;/a&gt; using SimpleText and a stone knife. He also worked at IBM and briefly at a startup that developed tablet computers before the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talks by Nik Molnar and Anthony van der Hoorn on Wednesday 30th July 2014 at the Robert Gordon University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Web Development with a Glimpse into ASP.NET&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the state of diagnostics on the web being what it is, we currently have to do a job that is much harder than it should be. Too often, the tools we are provided with only show a small part of the picture, leaving us to guess what else might be happening behind the scenes. Glimpse is an open source project that aims to change the way we think about diagnostics and the frameworks we interact with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After releasing Glimpse at Mix 11, Glimpse has become a tool that is used daily by tens of thousands of developers around the world. In this session, youíll learn how to use Glimpse to reveal a complete picture of what is happening within your ASP.NET MVC and WebForms sites, discover what tools are included out of the box, and see how you can easily extend it to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Web Sites Secrets, Exposed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s premier cloud solution for custom web applications, Windows Azure Web Sites, has brought the DevOps movement to millions of developers and revolutionized the way that servers are provisioned and applications deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included with all the headline functionality are many smaller, less-known or undocumented features that serve to greatly improve developer productivity. Join Microsoft MVP and veteran web developer Nik Molnar for a whirlwind tour of these secret features and enhance your cloud development experience.&lt;/p&gt;
