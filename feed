        <title>July 2015 Meeting - Matt Ellis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present the final night of Matt Ellis’s Scottish Tour. Join us on Thursday 23rd July 2015 at the Robert Gordon University to learn more about Microsoft’s recent move to open-source .NET!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.NETCore Blimey!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft have done the unthinkable and open-sourced .net, making it available on GitHub, and even taking it cross-platform. This is great news for developers, but do you know your .NET Core from your .Net Framework? Can you tell your CoreCLR from your CoreFX? And where does asp.net vnext and DNX come into this story? In this session, we’ll take a look at the big picture, dive deeply into some of the more interesting details and see how the pieces of Microsoft’s new .Net stack fit together, what it means for developers and find out exactly how you do run an .exe on Unix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eventbrite.com/e/aberdeen-developers-net-user-group-july-2015-meeting-tickets-17423404873?aff=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=11987778769&quot; alt=&quot;Eventbrite - Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group - July 2015 Meeting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Ellis is a developer at JetBrains, working on the Developer Advocacy team. He has 20 years of experience shipping software, having been a developer, team lead and technical authority for companies such as BBC Worldwide, BNP Paribas and Egg, the UK’s first internet bank. During that time, he has worked with a variety of platforms and technologies, from C++ and Unix to C#, Reactive Extensions and the Web. He currently works with language tooling, having fun with abstract syntax trees and source code analysis. He owns and contributes to various open source projects, and believes in the open closed principle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>June 2015 Meeting - Steven Chalmers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Steven Chalmers, on Thursday 18th June 2015 at the Robert Gordon University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting a helping hand from the Telerik Kendo UI and Reports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a new project based on heavy data entry and manipulation combined with getting to grips with new tech some help was required. I turned to using the Telerik tools in my ASP.NET MVC website. It simplified the data entry and the presentation of data and thus left lots of time to fight with CSS styling instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what I was getting and even if it was going to be of use. It looked pretty in the Telerik demos but how complex was it really? In the presentation I want to share some of the knowledge I gained to give a simple view on how the Telerik Kendo UI and the Telerik reports slot into the ASP.MVC environment. Hopefully you can gain enough information to decide if it will benefit your projects or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eventbrite.com/e/aberdeen-developers-net-user-group-june-2015-meeting-tickets-17071686875?aff=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=11987778769&quot; alt=&quot;Eventbrite - Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group - June 2015 Meeting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Chalmers has been programming on many different computers and embedded systems since the late 70&amp;rsquo;s. From typing in bytes, assembly all the way through to c#. In the past half year he has made a jump into new territory with the development of websites using ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, jQuery and the Telerik tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agenda - Thursday, 18th June 2015 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1800 - 1825: Arrival and registration&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OWIN is a set of open interfaces for web components on .net. Much has changed since the early days of that specification. What is OWIN? What does componentising mean for building web application? Expect to see code, slides, unicorns, Funcs and discussions about how to build your components now and be ready for asp.net vNext for free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sebastien Lambla has been involved in software development since receiving his first web browser, back in the days of Netsape Navigator 1.2. After a few years of hacking on javascript, he turned his attention to the .net platform, on which he would spend the next few years building software in many companies. From 2006, Sebastien has been running Caffeine IT, a consultancy helping clients from all over Europe implement first-grade and innovative solutions. Keen Open-Source promoter, Sebastien has created multiple high-profile open-source projects that are in use in many Fortune 500 companies, including OpenRasta, at a time the most popular resource-oriented framework on .net. Long-time advocate of the ReST architectural style and resource-oriented computing, Sebastien has delivered over the years new platforms leveraging the architecture of the web, from small independents to Fortune 500s.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Microsoft Exams</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Those who have been trying to book Microsoft Exams in recent months will be fully aware of the lack of local test centres in Aberdeen.  Unfortunately, there still appears to be a lack of any long term commitment for any new test centres, but Aberdeen Developers have been informed that there is some availability at a private session that has been organised at Aberdeen College on 27th November at 9am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen College are a Pearson Vue partner who don’t normally offer certification externally but Andrew at Motion Software has managed to arrange the use of this test centre for his team. He has kindly offered the remaining spaces to our members for a small fee (£5-£10) over the standard exam cost. Anyone looking to sit any Microsoft Exams should contact Andrew via his email [andrew]&amp;lsquo;at&amp;rsquo;[motionsoftware]&amp;lsquo;dot&amp;rsquo;[co]&amp;lsquo;dot&amp;rsquo;[uk] for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quick Survey - Aberdeen Testing Centre</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers have been approached by a local software development company who are keen to gauge the number of people that would welcome an Aberdeen test centre for Microsoft and Cisco exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the nearest test centres are in Edinburgh, Stirling or Glasgow. They would be very grateful if you could take a moment to answer a couple of quick questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to capture the answers to these questions in a Survey Monkey questionnaire, so if you could take the time to click on this link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MFVNDWZ&quot;&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MFVNDWZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And answer the two short questions, I would be really grateful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Your responses will be confidential with only numbers being shared with a potential test centre to assist them in their quest to be able to provide Microsoft and Cisco exams.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Upcoming BCS Talk - Daniel Russel</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Teaching 150K+ students at a time: The PowerSearchingWithGoogle.com story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to let you know about an upcoming talk that is being hosted by BCS Aberdeen, which I thought might interest you.  The talk is entitled ****, by Daniel Russell - Senior Research Scientist at Google:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have become incredibly popular in just the past 12 months. Many MOOCs have had more that 100K students register for their courses. Is this the future of online education? Or is it yet-another passing fancy in the educational technology parade? In the past 12 months we have run three MOOCs with more than 280K registrants. I&#8217;ll talk about what MOOCs are, how they&#8217;re actually run, the social community of learners that are essential for making MOOCs succeed, and what seems to work (and not work) in MOOCs. Along the way, I&#8217;ll talk a bit about how people seem to actually learn how to search&#8230; and do sensemaking as a task. I&#8217;ll also show evidence that behaviors learned in the MOOC persist after the end of class. %}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in attending this event, full details can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://aberdeen.bcs.org/events.php&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Room N311, RGU, Riverside East Building, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;About the speaker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Russell is the Uber Tech Lead for Search Quality and User Happiness in Mountain View. He earned his PhD in computer science, specializing in artificial intelligence until he realized that magnifying and understanding human intelligence was his real passion. Twenty years ago he foreswore AI in favor of HI, and enjoys teaching, learning, running and music, preferably all in one day. He worked at Xerox PARC before it was PARC.com, and was in the Advanced Technology Group at Apple, where he wrote the first 100 web pages for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com&quot;&gt;www.apple.com&lt;/a&gt; using SimpleText and a stone knife. He also worked at IBM and briefly at a startup that developed tablet computers before the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
