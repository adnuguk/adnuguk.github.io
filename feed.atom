		<content>&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present our first meeting in March where we will be joined by Mark Allan, on Wednesday 8th March 2017 at the Robert Gordon University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/march-2017-mark-allan-azure-functions-documentdb-tickets-31775756142?aff=blog"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=11987778769" class="img-fluid" alt="Eventbrite - Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group - March 2017 Mark Allan" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="azure-functions"&gt;Azure Functions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural evolution of Platform As A Service, Functions As A Service is the cornerstone of the new serverless paradigm. Learn how Azure Functions allows you to develop naturally scalable and event-driven &amp;quot;nano-service&amp;quot; solutions. Write exactly the code you need, with infrastructure and scaling taken care of for you, built-in security and integrations and a pay-per-second pricing model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="documentdb"&gt;DocumentDB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DocumentDB is Microsoft's cloud-first database solution for schemaless data. With DocumentDB you can query any collection of JSON data with SQL and JavaScript, and because it's designed for the cloud, you get guaranteed low latency, global replication, unlimited scale and a usage-based pricing model based on storage and throughput. Mark will discuss the usage of DocumentDB and how querying, indexing, consistency and so on differ from a traditional relational database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="speaker-bio"&gt;Speaker Bio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark is a software developer based on the beautiful North Coast of Ireland. He's been a professional developer since the 1980s and freelance since 2000, working on a myriad of projects for everything from local startups and councils to multinational corporations and federal government departments. While something of a technology omnivore, particularly if it's new and shiny, he currently tends towards Xamarin and ReactJS front-ends sitting on top of scalable Azure services, using a functional and reactive approach. You can find him on Twitter, LinkedIn and most other places as MarkXA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="agenda-wednesday-8th-march"&gt;Agenda - Wednesday 8th March&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1800 - 1820: Arrival and registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1820 - 1825: Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1825 - 1955: Azure Functions &amp;amp; DocumentDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1955 - 2010: Q&amp;amp;A and Prize Draw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="location-and-directions"&gt;Location and Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue: Room N345, The Sir Ian Wood Building, Garthdee Campus, Aberdeen, Aberdeen City AB10 7GJ, GB&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a Microsoft special meeting, on Thursday 23rd March 2017 at the Robert Gordon University. We're joined by Martin Kearn and Martin Beeby who are both evangelists from Microsoft. The Martin's will cover 4 topics including the future of the web, Machine Learning, Document DB and Conversation-as-a-platform (bots). The focus will be on general technology so this event will be suitable for .net developers and folks on other stacks. We're hoping for a full house to make the most of this one-off special event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/march-2017-microsoft-special-tickets-31775703986?aff=blog"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=11987778769" class="img-fluid" alt="Eventbrite - Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group - March 2017 Microsoft Special" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="agenda-thursday-23rd-march-2016"&gt;Agenda - Thursday, 23rd March 2016&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1800 - 1830: Arrival and registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1830 - 1840: Welcome and introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1840 - 1910: Martin Beeby - The Web on Day 10,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1910 - 1940: Martin Kearn - Machine Learning for Muggles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1940 - 2000: Break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2000 - 2030: Martin Beeby - DocumentDB: a NoSQL database-as-a-service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2030 - 2100: Martin Kearn - The Fuss about Bots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2100: Close&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="speaker-bios"&gt;Speaker Bios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="martin-beeby"&gt;Martin Beeby&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Beeby has been a developer since he was 16. Having no garage, unlike his American counterparts, he began developing small sites, apps and hacks from the comfort of his bedroom.
Today Martin works for Microsoft where he talks to developers about the Web. Martin has, over the past 17 years, worked on projects with many Major brands. Martin has written articles for, and been featured in, NET Magazine, Creative Bloq, SitePoint, ZDNet, the Microsoft Developer Network, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="martin-kearn"&gt;Martin Kearn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin is a technical evangelist for Microsoft based in the UK. In his role, Martin talks with customers, partners, start-ups and anyone who is willing to listen about developing applications on the Microsoft platform. This includes Windows, Office, Microsoft Azure and Web technologies including ASP.net and the Edge browser. Martin has been working with Microsoft development technologies since the late 90's and has been working for Microsoft directly since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="talks"&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-web-on-day-10000"&gt;The Web on Day 10,000&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're fast approaching 10,000 days since December 1990 when the first website was published and changed everything.
Martin looks at the future capabilities of browsers, devices and servers and how applications will be impacted by advances in those three areas. Using live code and demos he'll explores, amongst other things, Bots, Web Components, Web Assembly, Cognitive Services, Language Understanding, Speech and Serverless application architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="machine-learning-for-muggles"&gt;Machine Learning for Muggles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence is the latest hotness. Machine Learning sits behind artificial intelligence and on the surface it may seem like a deeply technical, scientific topic. We are here to tell you that it is more accessible than you think. We'll look at some of the basics around the Azure Machine Learning service. We'll also look some of the Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs which make it very easy to implement artificial intelligence 'smarts' into your application with simple, standard REST calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="documentdb-a-nosql-database-as-a-service"&gt;DocumentDB: a NoSQL database-as-a-service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DocumentDB is a database for document and key-value data, provided as a service inside on Microsoft Azure. It has all the properties of a NoSQL database whilst retaining the ability to easily query the data with SQL. Martin will look into how it works, when to use it and how you can utilise it from many different types of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-fuss-about-bots"&gt;The Fuss about Bots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say that Bots are the new Apps and thr way we interact with our devices is going to fundamentally change to a world where we are using natural language to interact with Bots and Digital Assistants. Microsoft are investing heavily in bots and have a tool called the Microsoft Bot Framework. In this talk we'll look at what a bot is, deisgn patterns for bots and the Microsoft Bot Framework which lets you write a single bot that is published to multiple social channels such as Skype, Facebook and Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="location-and-directions"&gt;Location and Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue: Room N117, The Sir Ian Wood Building, Garthdee Campus, Aberdeen, Aberdeen City AB10 7GJ, GB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="breezejs"&gt;BreezeJS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BreezeJS is a free, open source JavaScript library that helps you manage data in rich client applications. If you store data in a database, query and save those data as complex object graphs, and share these graphs across multiple screens of your JavaScript client, Breeze is for you. This presentation will introduce BreezeJs and demonstrate some of it's advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="storymapping-for-beginners"&gt;Storymapping for Beginners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is difficult to work out how to prioritise the backlog and effectively work iteratively while still holding on to the big picture. What do you put in your MVP (Minimal Viable Product)? What then goes in each incremental release to give your users more and more useful functionality? Storymapping is a technique for solving this problem and getting your solution to your users faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this highly interactive session I'll explain how you go about creating a story map and I'll get you to create one. Lots of sticky notes later you should have a fairly good grasp and be able to use the same technique on your own projects to better manage your backlog and keep everyone aware of the big picture while still working on individual stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/aberdeen-developers-net-user-group-september-2016-meeting-tickets-27403321071?aff=blog"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=11987778769" class="img-fluid" alt="Eventbrite - Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group - September 2016 Meeting" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin Mackay was C# MVP for 4 years (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010), and Code Project MVP (for 5 years) and, as of writing, is in the top 3% of StackOverflow users. He runs Scottish Developers and organises DDD Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-platform-for-more-personal-computing"&gt;A Platform for More Personal Computing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt and pepper. Fish and chips. Starsky and Hutch. Windows and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Windows became intrinsically linked with personal computing, Microsoft is working to make that just-over-the-horizon leap towards natural interaction and 'More Personal Computing' (MPC). It's already surfacing today in technologies like 'Cortana' and 'Windows Hello'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we'll take a demo-based approach to look at some of the MPC technologies that Windows developers already have available to them in the Universal Windows Platform and some additional technologies out in the cloud under the banner of 'Microsoft Cognitive Services'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll look at some things with pens, touch, speech, facial recognition, speaker identification and we'll see what the Windows 10 app platform has to offer developers building modern apps with an ever-more personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should expect Visual Studio, C# code and XAML UI and most of the talk will build up an application from scratch adding features as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/aberdeen-developers-net-user-group-july-2016-meeting-tickets-26418169456?aff=blog"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=11987778769" class="img-fluid" alt="Eventbrite - Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group - July 2016 Meeting" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Taulty works in the Developer and Platform Group at Microsoft in the UK where he has spent the past few years helping developers understand and get the best from the Microsoft platform. Prior to this, Mike spent 3 years with Microsoft Consulting Services as a consultant on developer technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Microsoft, Mike spent the previous 9 years working as a software developer for a number of enterprises, consultancies and software vendors working with a variety of operating system, client, communication and server technologies.

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Kendall Miller, on Thursday 12th May 2016 at Aberdeen University's Meston Building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take extra notice of the venue above!  Due to exams happening in our normal RGU venue, this talk will be being hosted by Aberdeen University, in the Meston Building.  Full details of the location can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="to-the-cloud-how-azure-helped-us-improve-the-scalability-of-our-saas"&gt;To The Cloud! How Azure helped us improve the scalability of our SaaS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year we had to make a decision whether to double down with new hardware in our Colo or go another way to grow our SaaS. In this talk we'll walk through the challenges we've faced moving from our own hardware to Azure including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking advantage of auto-scaling to reduce costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing 100x without controlling the hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it all goes wrong and Azure falls over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Azure has improved the performance of our on-premises installs too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from a theoretical conversation about how you could use the cloud, we'll share real data from our production implementation, both the good and the bad. Finally, we'll talk about where we're going with what we've learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/aberdeen-developers-net-user-group-may-2016-meeting-tickets-24846287916?aff=blog"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=11987778769" class="img-fluid" alt="Eventbrite - Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group - May 2016 Meeting" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="having-your-cake-and-eating-to-too"&gt;Having your Cake, and eating to too!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever wanted to create a build script for your application, but been faced with learning a new language, or DSL, or writing more XML than any person should ever need to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever wanted to create a build script that will work cross platform?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever wanted to create a build script that has first class support for the most common build tools like XUnit, WiX, SignTool, and many others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever wanted to create a build script that uses a language that you already know, and love?&lt;/li&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Gary Ewan Park, on Thursday 22nd October 2015 at the Robert Gordon University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="semantic-versioning-with-gitversion"&gt;Semantic Versioning with GitVersion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever needed to control the version number of your application? If so, you will know that this isn't something that you &amp;quot;get for free&amp;quot;. It's hard! You may have tried to use some form of auto incrementing number from your Continuous Integration Server, or store a text file in source control and update it each time the build happens. Both of these approaches will work, but they don't account for more complicated scenarios where you are working on multiple releases at the same time, or you want to use multiple Continuous Integration Servers. In this session, we will look at how we can improve the versioning of your application using a combination of branching strategies (either Gitflow or Githubflow) and an open source tool called GitVersion. GitVersion is a tool which allows you to easy generate the Semantic Version number for your application, based on the current state of your code base in it's Git Repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/aberdeen-developers-net-user-group-october-2015-meeting-tickets-18944026092?aff=blog"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=11987778769" class="img-fluid" alt="Eventbrite - Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group - October 2015 Meeting #1" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
