  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a Microsoft special meeting, on Thursday 23rd March 2017 at the Robert Gordon University. We’re joined by Martin Kearn and Martin Beeby who are both evangelists from Microsoft. The Martin’s will cover 4 topics including the future of the web, Machine Learning, Document DB and Conversation-as-a-platform (bots). The focus will be on general technology so this event will be suitable for .net developers and folks on other stacks. We’re hoping for a full house to make the most of this one-off special event.</p>

</ul>


<p><strong>Speaker Bios</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Martin Beeby</em></strong>
Martin Beeby has been a developer since he was 16. Having no garage, unlike his American counterparts, he began developing small sites, apps and hacks from the comfort of his bedroom.
Today Martin works for Microsoft where he talks to developers about the Web. Martin has, over the past 17 years, worked on projects with many Major brands. Martin has written articles for, and been featured in, NET Magazine, Creative Bloq, SitePoint, ZDNet, the Microsoft Developer Network, and many more.</p>

<p><strong><em>Martin Kearn</em></strong>
Martin is a technical evangelist for Microsoft based in the UK. In his role, Martin talks with customers, partners, start-ups and anyone who is willing to listen about developing applications on the Microsoft platform. This includes Windows, Office, Microsoft Azure and Web technologies including ASP.net and the Edge browser. Martin has been working with Microsoft development technologies since the late 90&rsquo;s and has been working for Microsoft directly since 2005.</p>

<p><strong>Talks</strong>
<strong><em>The Web on Day 10,000</em></strong>
We’re fast approaching 10,000 days since December 1990 when the first website was published and changed everything.
Martin looks at the future capabilities of browsers, devices and servers and how applications will be impacted by advances in those three areas. Using live code and demos he’ll explores, amongst other things, Bots, Web Components, Web Assembly, Cognitive Services, Language Understanding, Speech and Serverless application architecture.</p>

<p><strong><em>Machine Learning for Muggles</em></strong>
Artificial Intelligence is the latest hotness. Machine Learning sits behind artificial intelligence and on the surface it may seem like a deeply technical, scientific topic. We are here to tell you that it is more accessible than you think. We’ll look at some of the basics around the Azure Machine Learning service. We’ll also look some of the Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs which make it very easy to implement artificial intelligence ‘smarts’ into your application with simple, standard REST calls.</p>

<p><strong><em>DocumentDB: a NoSQL database-as-a-service</em></strong>
DocumentDB is a database for document and key-value data, provided as a service inside on Microsoft Azure. It has all the properties of a NoSQL database whilst retaining the ability to easily query the data with SQL. Martin will look into how it works, when to use it and how you can utilise it from many different types of applications.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Fuss about Bots</em></strong>
Some people say that Bots are the new Apps and thr way we interact with our devices is going to fundamentally change to a world where we are using natural language to interact with Bots and Digital Assistants. Microsoft are investing heavily in bots and have a tool called the Microsoft Bot Framework. In this talk we&rsquo;ll look at what a bot is, deisgn patterns for bots and the Microsoft Bot Framework which lets you write a single bot that is pblished to multiple social channels such as Skype, Facebook and Slack.</p>

<p><strong>Location and Directions</strong></p>

<p>Venue: Room N117, The Sir Ian Wood Building, Garthdee Campus, Aberdeen, Aberdeen City AB10 7GJ, GB</p>

<p><strong>DocumentDB</strong>
DocumentDB is Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud-first database solution for schemaless data. With DocumentDB you can query any collection of JSON data with SQL and JavaScript, and because it&rsquo;s designed for the cloud, you get guaranteed low latency, global replication, unlimited scale and a usage-based pricing model based on storage and throughput. Mark will discuss the usage of DocumentDB and how querying, indexing, consistency and so on differ from a traditional relational database.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker Bio</strong>
Mark is a software developer based on the beautiful North Coast of Ireland. He&rsquo;s been a professional developer since the 1980s and freelance since 2000, working on a myriad of projects for everything from local startups and councils to multinational corporations and federal government departments. While something of a technology omnivore, particularly if it&rsquo;s new and shiny, he currently tends towards Xamarin and ReactJS front-ends sitting on top of scalable Azure services, using a functional and reactive approach. You can find him on Twitter, LinkedIn and most other places as MarkXA.</p>

<p><strong>BreezeJS</strong></p>

<p>BreezeJS is a free, open source JavaScript library that helps you manage data in rich client applications. If you store data in a database, query and save those data as complex object graphs, and share these graphs across multiple screens of your JavaScript client, Breeze is for you. This presentation will introduce BreezeJs and demonstrate some of it&rsquo;s advantages.</p>

<p><strong>Storymapping for Beginners</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes it is difficult to work out how to prioritise the backlog and effectively work iteratively while still holding on to the big picture. What do you put in your MVP (Minimal Viable Product)? What then goes in each incremental release to give your users more and more useful functionality? Storymapping is a technique for solving this problem and getting your solution to your users faster.</p>

<p>In this highly interactive session I&rsquo;ll explain how you go about creating a story map and I&rsquo;ll get you to create one. Lots of sticky notes later you should have a fairly good grasp and be able to use the same technique on your own projects to better manage your backlog and keep everyone aware of the big picture while still working on individual stories.</p>
