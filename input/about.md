Formed in June 2010, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group is a non-profit user group which aims to benefit software developers in and around the Aberdeen area.

Primarily, we aim to offer in person events which deal with the various aspects of .Net Development. The topics for these meetings are decided by the User Group Committee, however, if there is a particular area that you would like to see an event on, then please feel free to get in touch with us.

It is our hope that all events will be provided absolutely free, or at a very minimal cost. We are able to do this through the generous support of our [sponsors](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/sponsors/), without whom this group would not exist.

**Meeting Location**

All the meetings of the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group take place at the Robert Gordon University in Garthdee Campus, Aberdeen.  We are very grateful to RGU who provide this venue free of charge.  One restriction that is placed on this use of this venue is that no food and drink is allowed within the lecture theatre, and this rule is enforced.
