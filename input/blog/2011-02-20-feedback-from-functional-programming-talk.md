I have finally got round to collating the feedback from the Functional Programming talk which was given on the 27th January 2011 (details of the talk can be found [here](http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Functional-programming-in--NET.aspx), with source code available [here](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Uploads/Meetings/Functional%20Programming%20Presentation.zip)).




The collated feedback can be found [here](http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/News/Feedback-from-Functional-Programming-User-Group-Me.aspx).




Overall, the talk was very well received, and we have to give a lot of thanks to Anthony for taking the time to do the talk.
