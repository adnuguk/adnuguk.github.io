It seems like ages since the last Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group meeting, but I am happy to say that our next event, scheduled for the 25th August, has now been confirmed.




We are lucky enough to have Jessica Meats of Microsoft doing a talk on SharePoint Online (Office 365) and the differences between it, and a full blown SharePoint server running in your environment.




Now, this time around we are going to try something a little different…




As I have mentioned at the last couple meetings, we are in the process of firming up the details on how we are going to make a move away from the Kentico CMS that we are currently using, in favour of some free services that can be used to organise events.




To that end, in order to register for this months event, you will have to head on over to [Eventbrite](http://adnuguk.eventbrite.com/), rather than the main Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group [website](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/). If you don't have an Eventbrite account don't worry, you can still register, using simply your first name, last name and email address. However, if you do sign up, which takes less than a minute, you will be able to easily register for future events.
