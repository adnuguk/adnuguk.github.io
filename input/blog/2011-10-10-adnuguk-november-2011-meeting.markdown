## Windows Runtime and Metro Apps for Windows 8




At BUILD 2011, Microsoft announced Windows 8. This upcoming version of Windows is probably the biggest change the OS ever went through. Windows 8 focuses on web, apps, touch and the tablet form factor. For developers, things will change as well. They need to be ready to build applications, called Metro applications, tailored for Windows 8 or adapt their existing applications for the new OS. Together with Windows 8, Microsoft announced Windows Runtime (WinRT), a new way of working with Windows.
As you can see, that's a lot of new stuff to get your head around! To help you, Gill Cleeren, Microsoft Regional Director and Silverlight MVP will explain you the new strategy that Microsoft is taking. In this talk, we'll see what WinRT really is, how we can use it to build Metro applications with and how we can leverage C# and Silverlight knowledge to build Metro applications. We'll take a look at a fully working application as well to give you a clear picture of all the knowledge you'll gather during this hour.
By joining this session, the developer story for Windows 8 will have less secrets for you!




## Silverlight 5 for LOB Development




Most Silverlight 5 sessions give you an overview of the most magical features in the platform. However, not everyone is busy building 3D-enabled applications or media-intensive applications. Most Silverlight developers build LOB applications. For this group, this session is exactly what you need. Gill takes you on a tour through the Silverlight 5 platform, showing you all the shiny new bits in the LOB department, including improved data binding, MVVM support, implicit styles, PostScript printing and much more. You'll leave the session with tons of plans to improve your current SL LOB application, that's a guarantee!
