As some of you may know, Gill Cleeren is coming to do two talks in Aberdeen on the 24th November. Full details and registration for this event can be found [here](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/post/2011/10/10/ADNUGUK-%E2%80%93-November-2011-Meeting.aspx).




What you might not know is that Gill is actually doing 4 events in the UK. They break down as follows:






  * [Monday 21st November: Liverpool](http://thestack-november2011.eventbrite.com/)


  * [Tuesday 22nd November: Newcastle](http://nebytesgcleerennov2011.eventbrite.com/)


  * [Wednesday 23rd November: Edinburgh](http://gillcleeren2011.eventbrite.co.uk/?ebtv=F)


  * [Thursday 24th November: Aberdeen](http://adnuguk-nov2011.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebtn)



If you don't get a chance to see him in Aberdeen, you might be able to catch one of the other sessions.
