Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Matt Lacey on Thursday 23rd Feburary 2012 at the Robert Gordon University.



## Getting started with Windows Phone



Developers make more money with Windows Phone apps than with iPhone ones....an increasing number of companies claim. It's an exciting opportunity and previous experience with Microsoft's tools and technologies can provide a head start when you want to begin learning how to create apps. This session will not only help you discover how to get started building apps for the fastest growing mobile marketplace but also provide advice on making your apps stand out. We'll cover all the essentials for the phone and also include a few tips that will help when you start building metro style apps for Windows 8 too.

## Speaker Bio



Matt Lacey is disappointed with most of the software experiences he's exposed to each day and dreams of a world where software works the way users want and need it to. He believes that things can be better and wants to help developers make things better. You'll often find him answering questions on StackOverflow and organising 2, yes 2, user groups: DevEvening and the Windows Phone User Group. Since the late 90's he's worked at a variety of companies (from the very large to the very small) and built software on more platforms and with more languages than he can remember. He currently works as a freelance mobile software developer specialising in Windows Phone. Read his development ramblings on his [blog](http://blog.mrlacey.co.uk/) and follow him on twitter ([@mrlacey](https://twitter.com/#!/mrlacey)).
