Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Rob Lally on Thursday 24th May 2012 at the Robert Gordon University.




## Jedi Mind Control 101




Control others with the power of your mind.




Make colleagues your unthinking puppets.




Bludgeon those who oppose you with your force of will.




Gain mastery of your enemies [Sith, Ewoks, Humanoid Resources].




Or, for the gentler amongst you, learn some practical techniques to help you effectively communicate your thoughts and ideas to others. The art of ethical persuasion. (No previous Force training necessary)
