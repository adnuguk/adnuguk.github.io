Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Chris Canal on Thursday 1st November 2012 at the Robert Gordon University.




## Single Page Application Development with backbone.js and Simple.Web




With the rise of smarter browser, single page applications are becoming more popular. In this session we will look at creating a full client side application with backbone.js, and use Simple.Web to run the server-side component of the application.




**Simple.Web**




A lightweight, object-oriented (Model-View-Handler) framework for modern web development in .NET




**Simple.Web Design Goals:**






  * Keep it simple;


  * It should be ridiculously easy to do TDD and/or BDD;


  * Support asynchronous, non-blocking handling of requests;


  * Make it easy to build a proper RESTful, hypermedia-driven application and services, including supporting content-type negotiation for all requests, including HTML;


  * Be really open and extensible, because if people can write plug-ins and add-ons easily, I don't have to build all that stuff in.




**Backbone.js**




Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.
