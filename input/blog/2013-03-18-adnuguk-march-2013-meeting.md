Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Gary Ewan Park on Thursday 28th March 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.

## Mmmm, Chocolatey Goodness!

Do you use Nuget to control the packages that you consume in your Development Projects? If so, a natural extension of this is to use Chocolatey (which is built on Nuget) to control the installation and update of actual applications on your machine. Chocolatey is a Package Manager system for Windows, think apt-get on Linux.

In this session, we re-examine the basics of a unit test. We will work through a number of examples with continuous input from attendees. Each example will start with a test of questionnable quality, and we will work through the issues till we're happy that it's as good as we can get it.

In this talk, we will look at what Chocolatey is, how you can use it, how you can create your own packages, and make use of it to create fresh installations of your developer systems.
