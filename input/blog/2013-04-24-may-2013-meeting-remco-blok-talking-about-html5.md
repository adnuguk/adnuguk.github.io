Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Remco Blok on Thursday 23rd May 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.

## HTML5 applications with Kendo UI and TypeScript

Taken from Telerik's Kendo UI website, Kendo UI is said to be a

"Comprehensive HTML5, JavaScript framework for modern web and mobile app development.

Kendo UI is everything professional developers need to build HTML5 sites and mobile apps. Today, productivity of an average HTML/jQuery developer is hampered by assembling a Frankenstein framework of disparate JavaScript libraries and plug-ins.

Kendo UI has it all: rich jQuery-based widgets, a simple and consistent programming interface, a rock-solid DataSource, validation, internationalization, a MVVM framework, themes, templates and the list goes on."

In this talk Remco Blok will talk about his experience using Kendo UI and TypeScript building HTML5 line of business applications, coming from the perspective of a Silverlight developer. He will pull no punches as he details his views on both Kendo UI's strong points and current weak points. He will go into examples of MVVM and data access to OData data sources using Kendo UI. Remco will also go into how using TypeScript with Kendo UI, instead of JavaScript, has helped him 'tame' JavaScript (at least in his mind).
