Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Kendall Miller on Thursday 17th October 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.


## Introducing Agile to the Enterprise


**Still Living in a Waterfall World? You're Not Alone!** Convincing your company to use an Agile development approach for application development can be surprisingly difficult. While the initial benefits excite everyone, that enthusiasm often disappears when the true trade-offs of Agile become apparent. You may even find that many members of the development team aren't willing to give up their waterfall patterns of development. How do you convince the business that good software doesn't begin and end with a giant Microsoft Project Plan? In this session we'll discuss how you can get your company moving down the path to more effective software development and bridge the gap between traditional practices and the current software development landscape




  * **How to discuss Agile with the Business:** It's their money, you need to make sure they're on board with how you're going to spend it.


  * **Convincing the Team to Work Differently:** Without the right patterns of development within your team, your first Agile project may be the last for a while.


  * **Useful Compromises:** When you can't change the world overnight, how do you at least get the ship turning in the right direction?


Presented by one of the founders of Gibraltar Software, we'll discuss how we've worked with many enterprise customers to marry agile practices into traditional teams. Sometimes successful sometimes a brilliant failure - come and learn from our mistakes so you can produce better results and have happier customers and team members. We won't be focusing on a specific technology or Agile approach but rather how you get businesses to accept giving up the Gantt chart and learn to love software development.
