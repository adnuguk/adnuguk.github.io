# Code from Abusing C# Talk


On Thursday 8th August 2013, Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group welcomed Jon Skeet for  a talk entitled "Abusing C#".  Full details of the event can be found [here](http://adnuguk.me/11ooiSC).

If you were not able to attend you can find the code that Jon used during his session on his Github account [here](https://github.com/jskeet/DemoCode/tree/master/Abusing%20CSharp).  Jon's presentation was dedicated to talking through his demo code, as a result, there are no presentation slides for this talk.
