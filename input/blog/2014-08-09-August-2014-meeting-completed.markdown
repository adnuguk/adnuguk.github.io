# Slides and Code from Web API 2 Talk

You can find the Slides and Code that Shawn presented [here][Shawn_Blog_Post].  If you want to get in touch with Shawn, you can use his twitter account [@ShawnWildermuth][Shawn_Twitter_Account]

# Prizes

For everyone who was lucky enough to win a prize from one of our [sponsors][sponsors_page], I have requested all of the prizes.  If you haven't heard anything, please get in touch, and I will try to sort this out.

# Feedback

As those of you who attended will know, I forgot to take the feedback forms with me, so I am reverting to using SurveyMonkey for this session.  If you would like to provide feedback for this session, then you can do so [here][SurveyMoneky_Link].

Everyone who was registered to attend the event should have received an email from SurveyMonkey about the above feedback form.
