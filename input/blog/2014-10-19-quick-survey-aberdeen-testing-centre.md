title: "Quick Survey - Aberdeen Testing Centre"
description: Description
---

Aberdeen Developers have been approached by a local software development company who are keen to gauge the number of people that would welcome an Aberdeen test centre for Microsoft and Cisco exams.

At present, the nearest test centres are in Edinburgh, Stirling or Glasgow. They would be very grateful if you could take a moment to answer a couple of quick questions.

I am going to capture the answers to these questions in a Survey Monkey questionnaire, so if you could take the time to click on this link:

And answer the two short questions, I would be really grateful!

**NOTE:** Your responses will be confidential with only numbers being shared with a potential test centre to assist them in their quest to be able to provide Microsoft and Cisco exams.
