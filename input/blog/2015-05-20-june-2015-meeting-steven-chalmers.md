**Getting a helping hand from the Telerik Kendo UI and Reports**

With a new project based on heavy data entry and manipulation combined with getting to grips with new tech some help was required. I turned to using the Telerik tools in my ASP.NET MVC website. It simplified the data entry and the presentation of data and thus left lots of time to fight with CSS styling instead.

At the start I didn't really know what I was getting and even if it was going to be of use. It looked pretty in the Telerik demos but how complex was it really? In the presentation I want to share some of the knowledge I gained to give a simple view on how the Telerik Kendo UI and the Telerik reports slot into the ASP.MVC environment. Hopefully you can gain enough information to decide if it will benefit your projects or not.
