** Slides and Code from June's Talk **

A massive thank you to Steven for sharing his experience and expertise at last night's meeting, and of course thanks to all those who managed to attend!

You can find the [Slides][slides] and [Code][steve_github] from Steve's presentation on his GitHub page [here][steve_github].  Also be sure to check out his [blog][blog] for some more information and tips including the [handy tip][griderror] for showing error messages from the server in a specific cell of the Telerik Grid.

For everyone who was lucky enough to win a prize from one of our awesome [sponsors][sponsors_page], I have requested all of the prizes.  If you haven't heard anything, please get in touch.
