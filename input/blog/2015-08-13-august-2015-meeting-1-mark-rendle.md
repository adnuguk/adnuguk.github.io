Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Mark Rendle, on Thursday 20th August 2015 at the Robert Gordon University.

## Docker Strangelove - ASP.NET 5 on Linux

Come and learn all about hacking on ASP.NET on Linux!

Linux is now an officially supported platform for ASP.NET applications and you can use epic open-source things like Docker to manage your deployments.

In this session Mark will show us how to run an ASP.NET 5 application on Linux, then in Docker on Linux, and a whole lot more going as far down the rabbit hole as time allows. There may even be time to set up a mini-cloud-within-a-cloud with automated deployments from GitHub!
