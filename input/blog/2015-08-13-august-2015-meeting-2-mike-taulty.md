Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Mike Taulty, on Thursday 27th August 2015 at the Robert Gordon University.

***

**Windows 10 and the Universal Windows App Platform**

Windows 10 is a big release for Microsoft. Commodious. Huge. Massive. Colossal. Humongous. ;-)

It's the end of a journey to unify Windows. It's the beginning of a journey for developers who want to take advantage of a universal app platform available across all Windows devices.

In this session, we'll dig into what's changed in Windows 10 for the Windows app developer. We'll talk about the Universal App Platform that makes it possible to build code that runs on all Windows devices and about the Extension platforms for code that targets specific device families.

We'll stay in Visual Studio as much as is possible and we'll lean towards C# and XAML.
