Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Colin Mackay, on Thursday 10th September 2015 at the Robert Gordon University.

**Continuous Delivery**

Manually delivery software can be a time consuming and error prone affair. Why have a valuable person sit and manually do this? They're bored, and as a result they're not paying full attention and mistakes happen. It isn't repeatable so all those deployments to the testing environment count for nothing when it all goes horribly wrong when deploying to the production environment. There must be a better way of delivering software.

There is!

Amazon reportedly deploys to production every few seconds, GitHub do it several times a day. What makes this possible is a continuous delivery pipeline - a set of processes and a culture of development that ensure that get you to the point where every commit to your source repository is a potential for production system.

Continuous Delivery aims to remove the issues with building, testing and ultimately deploying to production in a safe, repeatable, well tested and highly confident way. I aim to show you how to get started on this journey. It isn't as daunting as it first looks.
