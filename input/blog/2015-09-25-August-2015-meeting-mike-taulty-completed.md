Thanks once again to Mike for making the journey up to Aberdeen to deliver his awesome talk on Windows 10 and the Universal Windows App Platform!  If you want to get in touch with Mike, you can use his twitter account [@mtaulty][Mike_Twitter_Account] and make sure you follow him for up-to-date news, articles and tips. You can also find a copy of the slides used in the presentation [here][Mike_Slides].

** Prizes **

For everyone who was lucky enough to win a prize from one of our amazing [sponsors][sponsors_page], I have requested all of the prizes.  If you haven't heard anything, please get in touch, and we will try to sort this out.

As Mike mentioned, there is the possibility of getting some Windows 10 Swag in the form of t-shirts.  I am currently working on this, and once I know more, I will let you know.
