Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Mike Taulty, on Thursday 21th July 2016 at the Robert Gordon University.

**A Platform for More Personal Computing?**

Salt and pepper. Fish and chips. Starsky and Hutch. Windows and PC.

Just as Windows became intrinsically linked with personal computing, Microsoft is working to make that just-over-the-horizon leap towards natural interaction and 'More Personal Computing' (MPC). It's already surfacing today in technologies like 'Cortana' and 'Windows Hello'.

In this session, we'll take a demo-based approach to look at some of the MPC technologies that Windows developers already have available to them in the Universal Windows Platform and some additional technologies out in the cloud under the banner of 'Microsoft Cognitive Services'

We'll look at some things with pens, touch, speech, facial recognition, speaker identification and we'll see what the Windows 10 app platform has to offer developers building modern apps with an ever-more personal touch.

You should expect Visual Studio, C# code and XAML UI and most of the talk will build up an application from scratch adding features as we go along.
