Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present our first meeting in March where we will be joined by Mark Allan, on Wednesday 8th March 2017 at the Robert Gordon University.

[![Eventbrite - Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group - March 2017 Mark Allan](https://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=11987778769)](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/march-2017-mark-allan-azure-functions-documentdb-tickets-31775756142?aff=blog)

***

**Azure Functions**
The natural evolution of Platform As A Service, Functions As A Service is the cornerstone of the new serverless paradigm. Learn how Azure Functions allows you to develop naturally scalable and event-driven "nano-service" solutions. Write exactly the code you need, with infrastructure and scaling taken care of for you, built-in security and integrations and a pay-per-second pricing model.

**DocumentDB**
DocumentDB is Microsoft's cloud-first database solution for schemaless data. With DocumentDB you can query any collection of JSON data with SQL and JavaScript, and because it's designed for the cloud, you get guaranteed low latency, global replication, unlimited scale and a usage-based pricing model based on storage and throughput. Mark will discuss the usage of DocumentDB and how querying, indexing, consistency and so on differ from a traditional relational database.

**Speaker Bio**
Mark is a software developer based on the beautiful North Coast of Ireland. He's been a professional developer since the 1980s and freelance since 2000, working on a myriad of projects for everything from local startups and councils to multinational corporations and federal government departments. While something of a technology omnivore, particularly if it's new and shiny, he currently tends towards Xamarin and ReactJS front-ends sitting on top of scalable Azure services, using a functional and reactive approach. You can find him on Twitter, LinkedIn and most other places as MarkXA.
