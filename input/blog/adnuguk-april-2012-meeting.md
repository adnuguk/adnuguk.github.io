Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Colin Mackay on Thursday 26th April 2012 at the Robert Gordon University.

## Task Parallel Library

.NET 4 has some very nifty features to aid the creation of multiple threads of operation. In this talk I'll be introducing those features and demonstrating what they can do for you, how you can benefit... And importantly, some things you shouldn't do if you want to maintain your sanity.
