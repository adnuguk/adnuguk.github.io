Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Craig Murphy on Wednesday 14th December 2011 at the Robert Gordon University.

## The Importance of Requirements

### -- having some idea of what you're doing

Whatever your business, if it involves the construction of anything, it's best to have some sort of idea of what you're building. You don't see house builders working without drawings; they'll beaver away for a couple of months building a house. In the software business, it's not uncommon for us to spend many months or years working on the same piece of software, often with little clear business or user direction.

Over the course of 60 minutes, I will tell a war story that has consumed two years of my life, so far. In the absence of a clear set of requirements, he worked on a project without a specification. It grew arms and legs, there was scrap and rework, project managers came and went. I won't advocate any particular solutions (e.g. agile, waterfall, Scrum, etc.) but I will present "what worked for me" and will be happy to hear what works for you!
