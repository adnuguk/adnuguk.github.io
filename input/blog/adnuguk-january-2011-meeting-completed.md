Thanks again to Anthony Jones, who did an excellent introductory talk to Functional Programming on the 27th January 2011. Details of the event can be found [here](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Functional-programming-in--NET.aspx) and Anthony has provided the source code that was used during the presentation which you can download from [here](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Uploads/Meetings/Functional%20Programming%20Presentation.zip).

If you have any follow up questions from the event, please get in touch, and I can pass on your details through to Anthony.
