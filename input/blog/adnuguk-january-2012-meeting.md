Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Sebastien Lambla on Monday 23rd January 2012 at the Robert Gordon University.

## HTTP Caching 101

Caching is one of the most powerful feature of HTTP and ReSTful architecture, and also one of the most misunderstood. This session will review what can be done with HTTP, debunk a few myths and show some commonly-implemented patterns you can implement in your own clients.
