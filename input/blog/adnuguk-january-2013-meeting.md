Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Andy Gibson on Thursday 31st January 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.

## An Introduction to Nancy

"Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions."

Based on concepts introduced by the Sinatra framework in the Ruby world, Nancy is gaining popularity with .NET developers as a lighter, more flexible alternative to ASP.NET MVC. Combined with a switched-on and engaging community of developers, Nancy is great to work with in everything from individual hobby projects up to large, complex enterprise applications.

In this session we will delve into:

* The super-dupey-happy-path
* The basics of Nancy (modules, routes, views)
* Hosting options (not just ASP.NET/IIS)
* Testing
* Extensibility
