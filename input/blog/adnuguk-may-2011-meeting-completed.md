On Thursday 26th May, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group was fortunate enough to welcome [Gary Short](https://garyshort.org/) ([@garyshort](https://twitter.com/garyshort)) of [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/) to do a talk entitled "[Refactoring - Everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask](https://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Refactoring-%E2%80%93-Everything-you-Wanted-to-Know-but-we.aspx)".

If you were not able to attend the session you can find the slide deck from the presentation [here](www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Uploads/Meetings/RefactoringDeepDive.pptx), big thanks to Gary for giving us a copy of the slide deck. You can also check out the slides here:

NOTE: The above slide deck was gratefully converted into the above format using SilverSlide by Mark Mann ([@mark_mann](https://twitter.com/#!/@mark_mann)), you can find his blog [here](https://blog.mark-mann.co.uk/).  Thanks again Mark!

The presentation was very well received and I am happy to say that outside of the [Microsoft event](https://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/What-s-New-in-Silverlight-4-.aspx), which we held back in November last year, attendance was the highest that it has ever been!!

The User Group now has over 75 registered members, and attendance at our meetings is averaging around the 20 people mark, which is far better than I ever thought it would be an I started out in this little adventure, so I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to everyone who has been coming along! The User Group really would be nothing without you guys coming along!

As I mentioned on the night, I am planning on increasing the frequency of the meetings for the User Group. I have decided this for a number of reasons.

Firstly, I have had a lot of interest from speakers who would like to do talks at the User Group, and the bi-monthly cycle meant that I would have to put some speakers off until next year, which isn't great.

Secondly, I think that a more regular meeting cycle keeps up the level of interest. Based on the show of hands by the attendees on the night, as well as speaking to some other Group Leaders, a regular monthly slot seems to make a lot of sense. If for some reason it doesn't work for this User Group, then we can easily switch back.

First up for our new monthly slot is [Chris Eargle](https://www.kodefuguru.com/) ([@KodefuGuru](https://twitter.com/kodefuguru)), a Telerik Developer Evangelist from Columbia, South Carolina, who, while over here to do other talks in the UK, is going to stop by Aberdeen and do a talk entitled "[Secrets of a .Net Ninja](https://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Secrets-of-a--Net-Ninja.aspx)".

**NOTE:**

As some of you may have noticed, I have switched from using the #ADNUG hash tag to using #ADNUGUK on Twitter. This is due to the fact that there was a clash with the [Austin Dot Net User Group](https://www.adnug.org/), as well as the [Adelaide Dot Net User Group](https://www.adnug.com/), so if you are ever mentioning the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group can I ask you to use #ADNUGUK.
