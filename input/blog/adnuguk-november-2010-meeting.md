I have just been asked, via email, for some more details about our upcoming event on Silverlight 4, featuring Mike Taulty and Mike Ormond from Microsoft, so I thought I would post some.

The event will be broken up into two sessions, and we will be using two separate rooms to host the event. One room will be where the presentations will be held (A12), and the other, a break out room (A4) for some food and drinks between the presentations.

The evening will roughly consist of the following:

* 5.00pm - Guests start arriving
* 5.30pm - First presentation (Mike Taulty)
* 6.30pm - Break
* 7.00pm - Second presentation (Mike Ormond)
* 8.00pm - Back to the break out room for food and drink, and informal Q and A.

If you have any other questions about the event, then please feel free to drop us a line here:
