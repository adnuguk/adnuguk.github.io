And the announcements for the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group keep coming!

As I mentioned at our August Meeting I am happy to announce that [Mark Rendle](https://twitter.com/markrendle) of [Dot Net Solutions Ltd](https://www.dotnetsolutions.co.uk/) will be touring Scotland in October, stopping off in Aberdeen on Thursday 13th.

On the night, Mark will actually be doing two presentations:

"Functional Alchemy: Tricks to keep your C# DRY*"

and

"How to manage your manager"

You can find complete details of the talks, and register for it [here](https://adnuguk-oct2011.eventbrite.com/). To read about Marks own thoughts on the tour check out his blog post [here](https://blog.markrendle.net/2011/08/30/on-tour/).

As with the booking of the August and September Meetings, I am again using [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) to handle the registration of the October Meeting. In addition, I am going to use Eventbrite and [MailChimp](https://www.mailchimp.com) to send out the invitations for the Event. In order to achieve this, I have moved the email addresses of all registered Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group members to a contact list within Eventbrite and MailChimp. If for some reason you would like your email address removed from this contact list, then please do not hesitate to get in contact with [me](https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=38).
