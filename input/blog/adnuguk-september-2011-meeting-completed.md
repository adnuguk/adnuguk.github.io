On Thursday 29th September 2011, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group was fortunate enough to welcome [Phil Leggetter](https://www.leggetter.co.uk/) ([@leggetter](https://twitter.com/#!/leggetter)) of [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) to do a talk entitled "[Why the realtime web isn't just another buzz phrase and why we should give a tweet](https://adnuguk-sep.eventbrite.com/)"

If you were not able to attend the session you can find the slide deck that was used during the presentation [here](https://www.leggetter.co.uk/pusher/presentations/adnuguk_2011-09-29/why_the_realtimeweb_matters.html#7).

In addition, if you have any comments that you would like to make about the presentation, Phil has set up a feedback section on SpeakerRate, which you can find [here](https://speakerrate.com/talks/8484-why-the-realtime-web-matters). As always, feedback for these events is always welcome, and I would strongly encourage everyone to provide feedback.

If you have any other comments/suggestions about the User Group, then feel free to get in touch with me via my [blog](https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/).
