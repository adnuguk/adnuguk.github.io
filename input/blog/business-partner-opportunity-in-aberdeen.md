An ADNUGUK Member has informed me that he is looking for a business partner (must be an experienced developer) for a start up.

If you are interested and would like some more information, then please feel free to contact Stuart Armstrong at [stuart.armstrong01@gmail.com](mailto:stuart.armstrong01@gmail.com).

I am looking for someone who can get involved with the development of a new software product and commit around 20+ hours a week (evening and weekends). I expect it will take 6 - 12 months (depending on requirements) to have the first version ready.
