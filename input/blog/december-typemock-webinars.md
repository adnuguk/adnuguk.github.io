I just wanted to bring your attention to some upcoming webinars from one of our User Group sponsors, Typemock. They have 3 Webinars coming up this month:

* [Reducing Bugs Faster: Introduction to Unit Testing](http://www.typemock.com/webinar-unit-testing-december)
* [Real Life Unit Testing - Tools and Practices](http://www.typemock.com/unit-testing-tooldandpractices-webinar)
* [Unit Testing Legacy Code - Real World Examples](http://www.typemock.com/real-world-legacy-code-webinar)

Looks like there is some really good content in these sessions, and I for one am going to try to attend at least a couple of them.

If you are not able to attend on the day, remember that Typemock also provide their past Webinars for viewing as well, and you can find them [here](http://www.typemock.com/webinars/).
