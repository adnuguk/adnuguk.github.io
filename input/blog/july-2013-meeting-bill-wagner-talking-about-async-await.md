## Async / Await practices in C# 5

Learn current recommendations for asynchronous idioms. I'll cover strategies for handling event handlers and void methods, async over sync methods, sync over async methods, exception strategies, API design, unit testing strategies, and programming with Task and related classes. You'll learn a variety of techniques that make async programming feel more familiar and easier to adopt. You'll learn to love Task and Task.
