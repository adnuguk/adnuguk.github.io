Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present the final night of Matt Ellis's Scottish Tour. Join us on Thursday 23rd July 2015 at the Robert Gordon University to learn more about Microsoft's recent move to open-source .NET!

## .NETCore Blimey!

Microsoft have done the unthinkable and open-sourced .net, making it available on GitHub, and even taking it cross-platform. This is great news for developers, but do you know your .NET Core from your .Net Framework? Can you tell your CoreCLR from your CoreFX? And where does asp.net vnext and DNX come into this story? In this session, we'll take a look at the big picture, dive deeply into some of the more interesting details and see how the pieces of Microsoft's new .Net stack fit together, what it means for developers and find out exactly how you do run an .exe on Unix.
