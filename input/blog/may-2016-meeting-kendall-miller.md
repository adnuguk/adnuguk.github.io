Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Kendall Miller, on Thursday 12th May 2016 at Aberdeen University's Meston Building.

**NOTE:**

Please take extra notice of the venue above!  Due to exams happening in our normal RGU venue, this talk will be being hosted by Aberdeen University, in the Meston Building.  Full details of the location can be found below.

## To The Cloud! How Azure helped us improve the scalability of our SaaS

Last year we had to make a decision whether to double down with new hardware in our Colo or go another way to grow our SaaS. In this talk we'll walk through the challenges we've faced moving from our own hardware to Azure including:

* Taking advantage of auto-scaling to reduce costs.
* Growing 100x without controlling the hardware.
* When it all goes wrong and Azure falls over.
* How Azure has improved the performance of our on-premises installs too

Far from a theoretical conversation about how you could use the cloud, we'll share real data from our production implementation, both the good and the bad. Finally, we'll talk about where we're going with what we've learned.
