I just wanted to bring some upcoming events to your attention. With all the hype about Windows 8 and Visual Studio 11 releases lately, it looks as those Microsoft are following up with a huge number of in-person and webinar events. If you haven't already done so, I will recommend that you take a look here:

Although I would say that there are a higher number of events happening south of the border, there are still a fair number of events taking place in Edinburgh. Over the last year of so, I have been a number of these events and if you can make it, I would strongly recommend that you attend. I am already registered for the Windows 8 event in Edinburgh.
