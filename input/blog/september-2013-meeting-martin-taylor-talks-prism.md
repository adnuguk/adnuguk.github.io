Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Martin Taylor on Thursday 19th September 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.

## Building WPF and Silverlight Applications with Prism

Taken from Microsoft's Prism page on CodePlex:

_"Prism provides guidance designed to help you more easily design and build rich, flexible, and easy-to-maintain Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop applications, Silverlight Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), and Windows Phone 7 applications._

_Using design patterns that embody important architectural design principles, such as separation of concerns and loose coupling, Prism helps you to design and build applications using loosely coupled components that can evolve independently but that can be easily and seamlessly integrated into the overall application. These types of applications are known as composite applications."_

In this talk, Martin will talk about his experience using Prism for building applications for the WPF 4 and Silverlight 5 platforms. He will show you how Prism can help you:

* Modularise your application
* Implement MVVM effectively
* Create flexible user interfaces
* Communicate between components using loosely coupled events (publish/subscribe)

## Speaker Bio

Martin leads a small team of software developers at Genesis, delivering specialised engineering software tools for clients as well as internal LOB solutions. He started as a software developer in 1996, and has been developing for the .NET platform since its introduction in 2002. He has focused on native applications since the introduction of XAML to the Microsoft stack, and is never happier than when he has Visual Studio open on one monitor and Blend open on the other.

Martin lives in the shire with his wife and daughter, and can be seen playing guitar with his band "Fusion" at various weddings and events across the north-east of Scotland.
