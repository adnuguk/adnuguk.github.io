Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Max Vasilyev, on Thursday 24th September 2015 at the Robert Gordon University.

## Command Query Responsibility Segregation

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) have been around for a while and many people called and used this architecture/pattern differently. Probably many of you have read many articles about this approach, but never actually got to do it on practice.

In this session there will be a brief theoretical discussion followed by practical examples with code samples and discussion of benefits of this approach.
