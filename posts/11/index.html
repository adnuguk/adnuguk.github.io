  <div class="entry-content"><p>And the announcements for the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group keep coming!</p>

<p>As I mentioned at our August Meeting I am happy to announce that <a href="http://twitter.com/markrendle">Mark Rendle</a> of <a href="http://www.dotnetsolutions.co.uk/">Dot Net Solutions Ltd</a> will be touring Scotland in October, stopping off in Aberdeen on Thursday 13th.</p>

<p>On the night, Mark will actually be doing two presentations:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Functional Alchemy: Tricks to keep your C# DRY*&rdquo;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&ldquo;How to manage your manager&rdquo;</p>

<p>You can find complete details of the talks, and register for it <a href="http://adnuguk-oct2011.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. To read about Marks own thoughts on the tour check out his blog post <a href="http://blog.markrendle.net/2011/08/30/on-tour/">here</a>.</p>

<p>As with the booking of the August and September Meetings, I am again using <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a> to handle the registration of the October Meeting. In addition, I am going to use Eventbrite and <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> to send out the invitations for the Event. In order to achieve this, I have moved the email addresses of all registered Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group members to a contact list within Eventbrite and MailChimp. If for some reason you would like your email address removed from this contact list, then please do not hesitate to get in contact with <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=38">me</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems like ages since the last Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group meeting, but I am happy to say that our next event, scheduled for the 25th August, has now been confirmed.</p>

<p>We are lucky enough to have Jessica Meats of Microsoft doing a talk on SharePoint Online (Office 365) and the differences between it, and a full blown SharePoint server running in your environment.</p>

<p>Now, this time around we are going to try something a little different…</p>

<p>As I have mentioned at the last couple meetings, we are in the process of firming up the details on how we are going to make a move away from the Kentico CMS that we are currently using, in favour of some free services that can be used to organise events.</p>

<p>To that end, in order to register for this months event, you will have to head on over to <a href="http://adnuguk.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>, rather than the main Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">website</a>. If you don&rsquo;t have an Eventbrite account don&rsquo;t worry, you can still register, using simply your first name, last name and email address. However, if you do sign up, which takes less than a minute, you will be able to easily register for future events.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Thursday 7th July, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group was lucky enough to welcome <a href="http://www.kodefuguru.com/">Chris Eargle</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kodefuguru">@KodefuGuru</a>), a Telerik Developer Evangelist from Columbia, South Carolina, to do a talk entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Secrets-of-a--Net-Ninja.aspx">Secrets of a .Net Ninja</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Due to the format of this presentation, primarily focused around code demonstrations, there was only an introductory set of slides, so I have not posted them here.</p>

<p>However, all of the code (and much, much more) that Chris talked through on the night is available at his CodePlex Project which you can find <a href="http://kodefu.codeplex.com/">here</a>. I am in the process of downloading the latest version as I type <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>There was no messing around in this talk, we jumped straight into talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Private Member Inheritance</p></li>
<li><p>Removing the use of Out Parameters</p></li>
<li><p>Extension Method Refactoring</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced use of LINQ, Lambdas and Anonymous Methods</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There was a lot of content in this presentation, and there was certainly a lot of food for thought. The sample code helps in cementing how these techniques can be used in your day-to-day programming activities.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t able to go, but some of the guys took Chris to the <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/">BrewDog</a> bar for a round of <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/sink_the_bismark">Sink The Bismarck</a> after the meeting, I hope he doesn&rsquo;t miss his flight back home to the states today!</p>

<p>Big thanks to Chris for taking time to visit the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>As some of you may have noticed, I have switched from using the #ADNUG hash tag to using #ADNUGUK on Twitter. This is due to the fact that there was a clash with the <a href="http://www.adnug.org/">Austin Dot Net User Group</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.adnug.com/">Adelaide Dot Net User Group</a>, so if you are ever mentioning the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group can I ask you to use #ADNUGUK.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Thursday 26th May, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group was fortunate enough to welcome <a href="http://garyshort.org/">Gary Short</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/garyshort">@garyshort</a>) of <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/">DevExpress</a> to do a talk entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Refactoring-%E2%80%93-Everything-you-Wanted-to-Know-but-we.aspx">Refactoring - Everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you were not able to attend the session you can find the slide deck from the presentation <a href="www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Uploads/Meetings/RefactoringDeepDive.pptx">here</a>, big thanks to Gary for giving us a copy of the slide deck. You can also check out the slides here:</p>

<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=149156&amp;v=4.0.50401.0"> <img src="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=161376" alt="Get Microsoft Silverlight" /> </a></p>

<p>NOTE: The above slide deck was gratefully converted into the above format using SilverSlide by Mark Mann (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/@mark_mann">@mark_mann</a>), you can find his blog <a href="http://blog.mark-mann.co.uk/">here</a>.  Thanks again Mark!</p>

<p>The presentation was very well received and I am happy to say that outside of the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/What-s-New-in-Silverlight-4-.aspx">Microsoft event</a>, which we held back in November last year, attendance was the highest that it has ever been!!</p>

<p>The User Group now has over 75 registered members, and attendance at our meetings is averaging around the 20 people mark, which is far better than I ever thought it would be an I started out in this little adventure, so I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to everyone who has been coming along! The User Group really would be nothing without you guys coming along!</p>

<p>As I mentioned on the night, I am planning on increasing the frequency of the meetings for the User Group. I have decided this for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly, I have had a lot of interest from speakers who would like to do talks at the User Group, and the bi-monthly cycle meant that I would have to put some speakers off until next year, which isn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think that a more regular meeting cycle keeps up the level of interest. Based on the show of hands by the attendees on the night, as well as speaking to some other Group Leaders, a regular monthly slot seems to make a lot of sense. If for some reason it doesn&rsquo;t work for this User Group, then we can easily switch back.</p>

<p>First up for our new monthly slot is <a href="http://www.kodefuguru.com/">Chris Eargle</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kodefuguru">@KodefuGuru</a>), a Telerik Developer Evangelist from Columbia, South Carolina, who, while over here to do other talks in the UK, is going to stop by Aberdeen and do a talk entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Secrets-of-a--Net-Ninja.aspx">Secrets of a .Net Ninja</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>As some of you may have noticed, I have switched from using the #ADNUG hash tag to using #ADNUGUK on Twitter. This is due to the fact that there was a clash with the <a href="http://www.adnug.org/">Austin Dot Net User Group</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.adnug.com/">Adelaide Dot Net User Group</a>, so if you are ever mentioning the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group can I ask you to use #ADNUGUK.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Through the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers website</a> I have been made aware of a job vacancy in the Aberdeen area.</p>

<p>The role will be as a software developer working on a brand new browser based product.  In the short term, a prospective candidate would benefit from having some Delphi knowledge in order to work with some existing software.  In addition, it would be beneficial if the candidate lived in the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire area.  The position would also ideally suit someone who has, or is, working on their own concept and wants to be a “start up”, and is looking for some cash injection, as this type of investment is available.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the position and would like some more information, then please feel free to contact Peter Gillian on pjg at skylark dot co dot uk, or you can call him on 01330 823950.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>This article was submitted to the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group by Norman Noble.</strong></p>

<p>The idea for writing this came about when I was discussing <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">ASP.Net MVC</a> (Model View Controller) with an old friend Dave about a week ago. I was having a look at Microsoft’s latest version having briefly looked at MVC when it first came out with version 3.5 of the .Net Framework. Dave’s company had just successfully released their first commercial application written entirely in MVC and I was keen to hear his thoughts on things that he knew now that he wished he’d known at the start of the project. Dave told me that in the start they had followed the <a href="http://nerddinnerbook.s3.amazonaws.com/Intro.htm">NerdDinner tutorial</a> and had adopted the patterns used by the tutorial. He also told me that he was particularly impressed with the way that the tutorial had handled its validation code and that they saw that as the way forward. I decided that the best way to get back into this stuff was as ever to start cutting some code.</p>

<p>The tutorial is easy enough to follow and is very good at explaining the basics of MVC so if MVC is something you are interested in I would thoroughly recommend going through the tutorial. It will give you all you need to get going (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> can fill in the rest). One of the fundamental advantages MVC provides over standard ASP.Net development is that it makes your code easier to test. By testing I mean proper unit testing using a Framework like <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> or Visual Studios inbuilt MSTest. If you’re new or have limited experience in writing unit tests I would recommend reading <a href="http://artofunittesting.com/">the art of UNIT TESTING</a> by Roy Osherove. It’s an excellent read with lots of really useful tips based on the experience of both failed and successful projects. When it comes to unit testing and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> Roy really knows what he is talking about.</p>

<p>Getting back to the MVC tutorial, I followed it through section by section and eventually arrived at the section on validation. I was quite keen to see what was suggested as Dave had been particularly enthusiastic about how this example handled it. I was slightly disappointed to find that the validation was some simple schema based validation using partial classes on the existing LINQ to SQL classes. To give the article some credit it does explain quite thoroughly that schema based validation is not the greatest and should only be used in the simplest of cases where there are little or no business rules to be applied. You can see a full example of Schema based validation in <a href="http://nerddinnerbook.s3.amazonaws.com/Part3.htm">part 3</a> of the tutorial.</p>

<p>A basic example looks something like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/876f59b7-2636-4af8-b201-0447ad4fd6c0.png"><img src="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/876f59b7-2636-4af8-b201-0447ad4fd6c0_thumb.png" alt="876f59b7-2636-4af8-b201-0447ad4fd6c0" /></a></p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; Customer
  {
      &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; IsValid()
      {
          &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; isValid = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;;

         &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (Age &lt; 18)
          {
              isValid = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;;
          }

          &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; isValid;
      }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This got me to thinking about what I didn’t like about this particular method of performing validation and more importantly how I’d prefer to see it being done. In my opinion most validation is part of the business rules of a system and as such should be stored in the Business Layer of the application. Also having the validation in the Data Access Layer creates a dependency on the Data Store when creating unit tests which prevent your tests from being fully robust and subject to change should the data in the data store change.</p>

<p>A test for the code above may look something like:</p>

<pre><code>      [TestMethod]
      &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Customer_Over18_IsValid()
      {
          &lt;span class="rem"&gt;//Arrange&lt;/span&gt;
          Customer cs = CustomerRepository.GetCustomer(1);

          &lt;span class="rem"&gt;//Act&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; isValid = cs.IsValid();

          &lt;span class="rem"&gt;//Assert&lt;/span&gt;
          Assert.IsTrue(isValid);
      }
</code></pre>

<p>So as mentioned above this unit test is dependant on a Data Store (in this case a repository) which could be subject to change. This could then potentially break the unit test even though neither the validation functionality nor the Customer object have not changed.</p>

<p>The way I prefer to get round this is to create a validation class for each Entity in the business layer that contains a method that allows me to pass in the entity to be validated. This solves the two problems that I have by moving the validation code into the Business Layer allowing you to centralise all validation code instead of having some in the DAL and some in the BLL. It also removes the dependency on the actual entities as when writing your tests you can create stub objects that use the primary objects as base classes. You can then use these stubs in your unit tests assured that the validation functionality is being properly tested and will not be subject to breaking should your Data Store or its functionality change.</p>

<p>A basic example of this would be:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; CustomerValidator : ICustomerValidator
  {
      &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; IsValid(Customer cs)
      {
          &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; isValid = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;;

          &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (cs.Age &lt; 18)
          {
              isValid = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;;
          }

          &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; isValid;
      }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This method completely seperates the validation code from any dependencies as they can be injected in through the method call.</p>

<p>A test for the code above would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>      [TestMethod]
      &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Customer_Over18_IsValid()
      {
          &lt;span class="rem"&gt;//Arrange&lt;/span&gt;
          StubCustomer scs = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; StubCustomer(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"Norman"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="str"&gt;"Aberdeen"&lt;/span&gt;, 31);

          &lt;span class="rem"&gt;//Act&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; isValid = CustomerValidator.IsValid(scs);

          &lt;span class="rem"&gt;//Assert&lt;/span&gt;
          Assert.IsTrue(isValid);
      }
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above the StubCustomer class has been created which has the Customer class as a base class. As the creation of the item under test is now controlled the unit test is far more robust and is only concerned with the functionality it is supposed to be testing. Therefore the only thing that will break this test is a change in the functionality of Customer which is what you would expect.</p>

<p>There are variations of the example above. For instance you may prefer to “inject” the dependency through a property setter instead. The above example is simply the way I prefer to do it.</p>
