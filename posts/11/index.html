  <div class="entry-content"><p>And the announcements for the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group keep coming!</p>

<p>As I mentioned at our August Meeting I am happy to announce that <a href="http://twitter.com/markrendle">Mark Rendle</a> of <a href="http://www.dotnetsolutions.co.uk/">Dot Net Solutions Ltd</a> will be touring Scotland in October, stopping off in Aberdeen on Thursday 13th.</p>

<p>On the night, Mark will actually be doing two presentations:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Functional Alchemy: Tricks to keep your C# DRY*&rdquo;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&ldquo;How to manage your manager&rdquo;</p>

<p>You can find complete details of the talks, and register for it <a href="http://adnuguk-oct2011.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. To read about Marks own thoughts on the tour check out his blog post <a href="http://blog.markrendle.net/2011/08/30/on-tour/">here</a>.</p>

<p>As with the booking of the August and September Meetings, I am again using <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a> to handle the registration of the October Meeting. In addition, I am going to use Eventbrite and <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> to send out the invitations for the Event. In order to achieve this, I have moved the email addresses of all registered Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group members to a contact list within Eventbrite and MailChimp. If for some reason you would like your email address removed from this contact list, then please do not hesitate to get in contact with <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=38">me</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems like ages since the last Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group meeting, but I am happy to say that our next event, scheduled for the 25th August, has now been confirmed.</p>

<p>We are lucky enough to have Jessica Meats of Microsoft doing a talk on SharePoint Online (Office 365) and the differences between it, and a full blown SharePoint server running in your environment.</p>

<p>Now, this time around we are going to try something a little different…</p>

<p>As I have mentioned at the last couple meetings, we are in the process of firming up the details on how we are going to make a move away from the Kentico CMS that we are currently using, in favour of some free services that can be used to organise events.</p>

<p>To that end, in order to register for this months event, you will have to head on over to <a href="http://adnuguk.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>, rather than the main Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">website</a>. If you don&rsquo;t have an Eventbrite account don&rsquo;t worry, you can still register, using simply your first name, last name and email address. However, if you do sign up, which takes less than a minute, you will be able to easily register for future events.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Thursday 7th July, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group was lucky enough to welcome <a href="http://www.kodefuguru.com/">Chris Eargle</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kodefuguru">@KodefuGuru</a>), a Telerik Developer Evangelist from Columbia, South Carolina, to do a talk entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Secrets-of-a--Net-Ninja.aspx">Secrets of a .Net Ninja</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Due to the format of this presentation, primarily focused around code demonstrations, there was only an introductory set of slides, so I have not posted them here.</p>

<p>However, all of the code (and much, much more) that Chris talked through on the night is available at his CodePlex Project which you can find <a href="http://kodefu.codeplex.com/">here</a>. I am in the process of downloading the latest version as I type <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>There was no messing around in this talk, we jumped straight into talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Private Member Inheritance</p></li>
<li><p>Removing the use of Out Parameters</p></li>
<li><p>Extension Method Refactoring</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced use of LINQ, Lambdas and Anonymous Methods</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There was a lot of content in this presentation, and there was certainly a lot of food for thought. The sample code helps in cementing how these techniques can be used in your day-to-day programming activities.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t able to go, but some of the guys took Chris to the <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/">BrewDog</a> bar for a round of <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/sink_the_bismark">Sink The Bismarck</a> after the meeting, I hope he doesn&rsquo;t miss his flight back home to the states today!</p>

<p>Big thanks to Chris for taking time to visit the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>As some of you may have noticed, I have switched from using the #ADNUG hash tag to using #ADNUGUK on Twitter. This is due to the fact that there was a clash with the <a href="http://www.adnug.org/">Austin Dot Net User Group</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.adnug.com/">Adelaide Dot Net User Group</a>, so if you are ever mentioning the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group can I ask you to use #ADNUGUK.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Thursday 26th May, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group was fortunate enough to welcome <a href="http://garyshort.org/">Gary Short</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/garyshort">@garyshort</a>) of <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/">DevExpress</a> to do a talk entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Refactoring-%E2%80%93-Everything-you-Wanted-to-Know-but-we.aspx">Refactoring - Everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you were not able to attend the session you can find the slide deck from the presentation <a href="www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Uploads/Meetings/RefactoringDeepDive.pptx">here</a>, big thanks to Gary for giving us a copy of the slide deck. You can also check out the slides here:</p>

<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=149156&amp;v=4.0.50401.0"> <img src="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=161376" alt="Get Microsoft Silverlight" /> </a></p>

<p>NOTE: The above slide deck was gratefully converted into the above format using SilverSlide by Mark Mann (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/@mark_mann">@mark_mann</a>), you can find his blog <a href="http://blog.mark-mann.co.uk/">here</a>.  Thanks again Mark!</p>

<p>The presentation was very well received and I am happy to say that outside of the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/What-s-New-in-Silverlight-4-.aspx">Microsoft event</a>, which we held back in November last year, attendance was the highest that it has ever been!!</p>

<p>The User Group now has over 75 registered members, and attendance at our meetings is averaging around the 20 people mark, which is far better than I ever thought it would be an I started out in this little adventure, so I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to everyone who has been coming along! The User Group really would be nothing without you guys coming along!</p>

<p>As I mentioned on the night, I am planning on increasing the frequency of the meetings for the User Group. I have decided this for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly, I have had a lot of interest from speakers who would like to do talks at the User Group, and the bi-monthly cycle meant that I would have to put some speakers off until next year, which isn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think that a more regular meeting cycle keeps up the level of interest. Based on the show of hands by the attendees on the night, as well as speaking to some other Group Leaders, a regular monthly slot seems to make a lot of sense. If for some reason it doesn&rsquo;t work for this User Group, then we can easily switch back.</p>

<p>First up for our new monthly slot is <a href="http://www.kodefuguru.com/">Chris Eargle</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kodefuguru">@KodefuGuru</a>), a Telerik Developer Evangelist from Columbia, South Carolina, who, while over here to do other talks in the UK, is going to stop by Aberdeen and do a talk entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Secrets-of-a--Net-Ninja.aspx">Secrets of a .Net Ninja</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>As some of you may have noticed, I have switched from using the #ADNUG hash tag to using #ADNUGUK on Twitter. This is due to the fact that there was a clash with the <a href="http://www.adnug.org/">Austin Dot Net User Group</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.adnug.com/">Adelaide Dot Net User Group</a>, so if you are ever mentioning the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group can I ask you to use #ADNUGUK.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Through the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers website</a> I have been made aware of a job vacancy in the Aberdeen area.</p>

<p>The role will be as a software developer working on a brand new browser based product.  In the short term, a prospective candidate would benefit from having some Delphi knowledge in order to work with some existing software.  In addition, it would be beneficial if the candidate lived in the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire area.  The position would also ideally suit someone who has, or is, working on their own concept and wants to be a “start up”, and is looking for some cash injection, as this type of investment is available.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the position and would like some more information, then please feel free to contact Peter Gillian on pjg at skylark dot co dot uk, or you can call him on 01330 823950.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have finally got round to collating the feedback from the Functional Programming talk which was given on the 27th January 2011 (details of the talk can be found <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Functional-programming-in--NET.aspx">here</a>, with source code available <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Uploads/Meetings/Functional%20Programming%20Presentation.zip">here</a>).</p>

<p>The collated feedback can be found <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/News/Feedback-from-Functional-Programming-User-Group-Me.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, the talk was very well received, and we have to give a lot of thanks to Anthony for taking the time to do the talk.</p>
