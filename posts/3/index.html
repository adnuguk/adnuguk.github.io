<p>Modern Web Development with a Glimpse into ASP.NET</p>

<p>With the state of diagnostics on the web being what it is, we currently have to do a job that is much harder than it should be. Too often, the tools we are provided with only show a small part of the picture, leaving us to guess what else might be happening behind the scenes. Glimpse is an open source project that aims to change the way we think about diagnostics and the frameworks we interact with.</p>

<p>After releasing Glimpse at Mix 11, Glimpse has become a tool that is used daily by tens of thousands of developers around the world. In this session, youíll learn how to use Glimpse to reveal a complete picture of what is happening within your ASP.NET MVC and WebForms sites, discover what tools are included out of the box, and see how you can easily extend it to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Azure Web Sites Secrets, Exposed</p>

<p>Microsoft’s premier cloud solution for custom web applications, Windows Azure Web Sites, has brought the DevOps movement to millions of developers and revolutionized the way that servers are provisioned and applications deployed.</p>

<p>Included with all the headline functionality are many smaller, less-known or undocumented features that serve to greatly improve developer productivity. Join Microsoft MVP and veteran web developer Nik Molnar for a whirlwind tour of these secret features and enhance your cloud development experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Max Vasilyev on Thursday 17th November 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2>From zero to 1000 tests in 6 months</h2>

<p>Not every team in the industry is writing automated tests. And it is very difficult to convince everyone on the team and especially business people, that tests must be written.
That initial leap from no tests to some test is the most difficult and many people give up on that stage.</p>

<p>I would like to talk how we managed to jump that gap and started to write tests in our every-day process.
Topics discussed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ADD: Annoyance Driven Development</p></li>
<li><p>Isolation Frameworks</p></li>
<li><p>Dependency Injection</p></li>
<li><p>Automocking container</p></li>
<li><p>continuous Integration</p></li>
<li><p>Reflection in tests</p></li>
<li><p>Unit or no unit test?</p></li>
<li><p>Books review</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>

<p>Max Vasilyev is Senior Developer and QA Manager is Solutions Aberdeen. He have been working with .Net for the last 3 years and before that he worked as a developer in SQL Server.
In the past year he increased his interest in automated testing of the software, as he got very frustrated with constant bugs and shady coding techniques.
So the last year was a constant uphill battle with the business to improve coding quality and increase code test coverage.</p>

<p>The battle is not won yet, but now business agrees that tests are important and any team using Agile must have tests.</p>

<h2>Agenda – Thursday, 21st October 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>1800 - 1815: Arrival and registration</p></li>
<li><p>1815 - 1820: Introduction</p></li>
<li><p>1820 - 2000: From zero to 1000 tests in 6 months</p></li>
<li><p>2000 onwards: Questions and drinks at the bar</p></li>
</ul>
