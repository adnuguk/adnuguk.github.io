  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Martin Taylor on Thursday 19th September 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2>Building WPF and Silverlight Applications with Prism</h2>

<p>Taken from Microsoft&rsquo;s Prism page on CodePlex:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Prism provides guidance designed to help you more easily design and build rich, flexible, and easy-to-maintain Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop applications, Silverlight Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), and Windows Phone 7 applications.</em></p>

<p><em>Using design patterns that embody important architectural design principles, such as separation of concerns and loose coupling, Prism helps you to design and build applications using loosely coupled components that can evolve independently but that can be easily and seamlessly integrated into the overall application. These types of applications are known as composite applications.&ldquo;</em></p>

<p>In this talk, Martin will talk about his experience using Prism for building applications for the WPF 4 and Silverlight 5 platforms. He will show you how Prism can help you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Modularise your application</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MVVM effectively</p></li>
<li><p>Create flexible user interfaces</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate between components using loosely coupled events (publish/subscribe)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>

<p>Martin leads a small team of software developers at Genesis, delivering specialised engineering software tools for clients as well as internal LOB solutions. He started as a software developer in 1996, and has been developing for the .NET platform since its introduction in 2002. He has focused on native applications since the introduction of XAML to the Microsoft stack, and is never happier than when he has Visual Studio open on one monitor and Blend open on the other.</p>

<p>Martin lives in the shire with his wife and daughter, and can be seen playing guitar with his band &ldquo;Fusion&rdquo; at various weddings and events across the north-east of Scotland.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Jon Skeet on Thursday 8th August 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2>Abusing C</h2>

<p>As a purely amateur C# developer, code that I write rarely gets to hurt people. (Well, open source projects aside.) As such, it&rsquo;s fun to stretch the language a bit, find its limits&hellip; and then try to sneak past them. One of my first reactions to a new language feature is &ldquo;How can I use that for a completely different purpose to the intended one?&rdquo; The results are rarely pretty, but they&rsquo;re lots of fun.</p>

<p>The chances of any of the code you see in this session being even remotely useful to a conscientious developer are very slim. You may well learn some interesting things about the C# language, but that&rsquo;s a different matter. To put it another way: if you&rsquo;re trying to persuade your boss that it&rsquo;s important to send you for educational reasons, you probably don&rsquo;t want to show him this abstract.</p>

<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>

<p>Jon Skeet is a Java developer for Google in London, but he plays with C# (somewhat obsessively) in his free time.</p>

<p>He loves writing and talking about C#, and the third edition of &ldquo;C# in Depth&rdquo; was published earlier this year. Writing less formally, Jon spends a lot of time on Stack Overflow&hellip; where &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; is an understatement. Give him a puzzle about how C# behaves which gets him reaching for the language specification, and Jon is a happy bunny. Jon lives in Reading with his wife and three children.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Remco Blok on Thursday 23rd May 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2><strong>HTML5 applications with Kendo UI and TypeScript</strong></h2>

<p>Taken from Telerik&rsquo;s Kendo UI website, Kendo UI is said to be a</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comprehensive HTML5, JavaScript framework for modern web and mobile app development.</p>

<p>Kendo UI is everything professional developers need to build HTML5 sites and mobile apps. Today, productivity of an average HTML/jQuery developer is hampered by assembling a Frankenstein framework of disparate JavaScript libraries and plug-ins.</p>

<p>Kendo UI has it all: rich jQuery-based widgets, a simple and consistent programming interface, a rock-solid DataSource, validation, internationalization, a MVVM framework, themes, templates and the list goes on.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this talk Remco Blok will talk about his experience using Kendo UI and TypeScript building HTML5 line of business applications, coming from the perspective of a Silverlight developer. He will pull no punches as he details his views on both Kendo UI&rsquo;s strong points and current weak points. He will go into examples of MVVM and data access to OData data sources using Kendo UI. Remco will also go into how using TypeScript with Kendo UI, instead of JavaScript, has helped him &lsquo;tame&rsquo; JavaScript (at least in his mind).</p>
