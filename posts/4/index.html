  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those who have been trying to book Microsoft Exams in recent months will be fully aware of the lack of local test centres in Aberdeen.  Unfortunately, there still appears to be a lack of any long term commitment for any new test centres, but Aberdeen Developers have been informed that there is some availability at a private session that has been organised at Aberdeen College on 27th November at 9am.</p>

<p>Aberdeen College are a Pearson Vue partner who don’t normally offer certification externally but Andrew at Motion Software has managed to arrange the use of this test centre for his team. He has kindly offered the remaining spaces to our members for a small fee (£5-£10) over the standard exam cost. Anyone looking to sit any Microsoft Exams should contact Andrew via his email [andrew]&lsquo;at&rsquo;[motionsoftware]&lsquo;dot&rsquo;[co]&lsquo;dot&rsquo;[uk] for more details.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers have been approached by a local software development company who are keen to gauge the number of people that would welcome an Aberdeen test centre for Microsoft and Cisco exams.</p>

<p>At present, the nearest test centres are in Edinburgh, Stirling or Glasgow. They would be very grateful if you could take a moment to answer a couple of quick questions.</p>

<p>I am going to capture the answers to these questions in a Survey Monkey questionnaire, so if you could take the time to click on this link:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MFVNDWZ">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MFVNDWZ</a></p>

<p>And answer the two short questions, I would be really grateful!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Your responses will be confidential with only numbers being shared with a potential test centre to assist them in their quest to be able to provide Microsoft and Cisco exams.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Teaching 150K+ students at a time: The PowerSearchingWithGoogle.com story</h2>

<p>Just wanted to let you know about an upcoming talk that is being hosted by BCS Aberdeen, which I thought might interest you.  The talk is entitled ****, by Daniel Russell - Senior Research Scientist at Google:</p>

<blockquote><p>MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have become incredibly popular in just the past 12 months. Many MOOCs have had more that 100K students register for their courses. Is this the future of online education? Or is it yet-another passing fancy in the educational technology parade? In the past 12 months we have run three MOOCs with more than 280K registrants. I&#8217;ll talk about what MOOCs are, how they&#8217;re actually run, the social community of learners that are essential for making MOOCs succeed, and what seems to work (and not work) in MOOCs. Along the way, I&#8217;ll talk a bit about how people seem to actually learn how to search&#8230; and do sensemaking as a task. I&#8217;ll also show evidence that behaviors learned in the MOOC persist after the end of class. %}</p></blockquote>
