  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Remco Blok on Thursday 23rd May 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2><strong>HTML5 applications with Kendo UI and TypeScript</strong></h2>

<p>Taken from Telerik&rsquo;s Kendo UI website, Kendo UI is said to be a</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comprehensive HTML5, JavaScript framework for modern web and mobile app development.</p>

<p>Kendo UI is everything professional developers need to build HTML5 sites and mobile apps. Today, productivity of an average HTML/jQuery developer is hampered by assembling a Frankenstein framework of disparate JavaScript libraries and plug-ins.</p>

<p>Kendo UI has it all: rich jQuery-based widgets, a simple and consistent programming interface, a rock-solid DataSource, validation, internationalization, a MVVM framework, themes, templates and the list goes on.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this talk Remco Blok will talk about his experience using Kendo UI and TypeScript building HTML5 line of business applications, coming from the perspective of a Silverlight developer. He will pull no punches as he details his views on both Kendo UI&rsquo;s strong points and current weak points. He will go into examples of MVVM and data access to OData data sources using Kendo UI. Remco will also go into how using TypeScript with Kendo UI, instead of JavaScript, has helped him &lsquo;tame&rsquo; JavaScript (at least in his mind).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Gill Cleeren on Tuesday 23rd April 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2><strong>Applied MVVM in Windows 8 Apps: not your typical MVVM session!</strong></h2>

<p>For some time now, the community has been touting the MVVM pattern as being the best way to build XAML-based applications. By now, you should be convinced that MVVM is really the way to go. But then, you start building a real-world Windows 8 application and you encounter all kinds of challenges you hadn&rsquo;t thought about before. How do I properly structure an application? How do I implement navigation? How do I manage tiles or contracts from MVVM? How do I use Dependency injection correctly? And how do the new data controls in Windows 8 work in combination with MVVM?</p>

<p>A whole list of questions that this session will aim at answering!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Gary Ewan Park on Thursday 28th March 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2><strong>Mmmm, Chocolatey Goodness!</strong></h2>

<p>Do you use Nuget to control the packages that you consume in your Development Projects? If so, a natural extension of this is to use Chocolatey (which is built on Nuget) to control the installation and update of actual applications on your machine. Chocolatey is a Package Manager system for Windows, think apt-get on Linux.</p>

<p>In this session, we re-examine the basics of a unit test. We will work through a number of examples with continuous input from attendees. Each example will start with a test of questionnable quality, and we will work through the issues till we&rsquo;re happy that it&rsquo;s as good as we can get it.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will look at what Chocolatey is, how you can use it, how you can create your own packages, and make use of it to create fresh installations of your developer systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Seb Rose on Thursday 28th February 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2><strong>Bad Test, Good Test</strong></h2>

<p>Foundational unit testing techniques are often taken for granted, but are an essential underpinning for delivering maintainable software. The tests need to assist software development not hinder it, and to that end need to be flexible, robust, comprehensible and performant. if you find yourself fighting your test suite, then something is wrong.</p>

<p>In this session, we re-examine the basics of a unit test. We will work through a number of examples with continuous input from attendees. Each example will start with a test of questionnable quality, and we will work through the issues till we&rsquo;re happy that it&rsquo;s as good as we can get it.</p>

<p>Although this session is not specifically about the testability of software, this will necessarily be touched upon as we consider some test cases. Examples will be written in several common languages, but knowledge of all (or any) of them is not a pre-requisite.</p>
