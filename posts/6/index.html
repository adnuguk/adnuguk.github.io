  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Gill Cleeren on Tuesday 23rd April 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2><strong>Applied MVVM in Windows 8 Apps: not your typical MVVM session!</strong></h2>

<p>For some time now, the community has been touting the MVVM pattern as being the best way to build XAML-based applications. By now, you should be convinced that MVVM is really the way to go. But then, you start building a real-world Windows 8 application and you encounter all kinds of challenges you hadn&rsquo;t thought about before. How do I properly structure an application? How do I implement navigation? How do I manage tiles or contracts from MVVM? How do I use Dependency injection correctly? And how do the new data controls in Windows 8 work in combination with MVVM?</p>

<p>A whole list of questions that this session will aim at answering!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Gary Ewan Park on Thursday 28th March 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2><strong>Mmmm, Chocolatey Goodness!</strong></h2>

<p>Do you use Nuget to control the packages that you consume in your Development Projects? If so, a natural extension of this is to use Chocolatey (which is built on Nuget) to control the installation and update of actual applications on your machine. Chocolatey is a Package Manager system for Windows, think apt-get on Linux.</p>

<p>In this session, we re-examine the basics of a unit test. We will work through a number of examples with continuous input from attendees. Each example will start with a test of questionnable quality, and we will work through the issues till we&rsquo;re happy that it&rsquo;s as good as we can get it.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will look at what Chocolatey is, how you can use it, how you can create your own packages, and make use of it to create fresh installations of your developer systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Seb Rose on Thursday 28th February 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2><strong>Bad Test, Good Test</strong></h2>

<p>Foundational unit testing techniques are often taken for granted, but are an essential underpinning for delivering maintainable software. The tests need to assist software development not hinder it, and to that end need to be flexible, robust, comprehensible and performant. if you find yourself fighting your test suite, then something is wrong.</p>

<p>In this session, we re-examine the basics of a unit test. We will work through a number of examples with continuous input from attendees. Each example will start with a test of questionnable quality, and we will work through the issues till we&rsquo;re happy that it&rsquo;s as good as we can get it.</p>

<p>Although this session is not specifically about the testability of software, this will necessarily be touched upon as we consider some test cases. Examples will be written in several common languages, but knowledge of all (or any) of them is not a pre-requisite.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Andy Gibson on Thursday 31st January 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2>An Introduction to Nancy</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Based on concepts introduced by the Sinatra framework in the Ruby world, Nancy is gaining popularity with .NET developers as a lighter, more flexible alternative to ASP.NET MVC. Combined with a switched-on and engaging community of developers, Nancy is great to work with in everything from individual hobby projects up to large, complex enterprise applications.</p>

<p>In this session we will delve into:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The super-dupey-happy-path</p></li>
<li><p>The basics of Nancy (modules, routes, views)</p></li>
<li><p>Hosting options (not just ASP.NET/IIS)</p></li>
<li><p>Testing</p></li>
<li><p>Extensibility</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>

<p>Andy Gibson is a Web/Support Programmer in Edinburgh with a background in web application development including ASP.NET MVC, Umbraco, PHP and jQuery. He is always on the lookout for new technologies to play with and loves to learn what he can about things especially in the web development arena.</p>

<p>Keen to give back to the community, Andy has spoken at a number of community events including many of the DDD series as well as at local user groups. He is currently chairman of Scottish Developers, a user group for programmers all across Scotland, for which he organises various talks and events including DDD Scotland and DunDDD.</p>

<p>In his spare time (not that he has much), Andy enjoys table-top wargamming, computer games, Formula 1, and writing more code.</p>

<p>Technical environment is front to back C#, .Net, Oracle.</p>

<p><strong>Why do this job?</strong></p>

<p>The variety of the role is exceptional, you’re not working or supporting the same systems and tools every day. There is no red tape or politics, you’re expected to hit the ground running and take responsibility for your work, right the way through the SDLC.</p>

<p>The position could move into more of a Technical Business Analyst role over time should you wish it. Alternatively you could move more into a Solutions Architect type role if you showed suitable enterprise.</p>

<p>There are opportunities across the globe if you should ever get bored. AMEC always try to retain their staff where possible and have one of the highest employee satisfaction rates in Scotland.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><strong>NOTE: Unfortunately, we have had to cancel this event.  I am going to try to re-schedule it for later in the year, but for now, the event will NOT be happening!</strong></em></p>

<p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Chris Canal on Thursday 1st November 2012 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2>Single Page Application Development with backbone.js and Simple.Web</h2>

<p>With the rise of smarter browser, single page applications are becoming more popular. In this session we will look at creating a full client side application with backbone.js, and use Simple.Web to run the server-side component of the application.</p>

<p><strong>Simple.Web</strong></p>

<p>A lightweight, object-oriented (Model-View-Handler) framework for modern web development in .NET</p>

<p><strong>Simple.Web Design Goals:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keep it simple;</p></li>
<li><p>It should be ridiculously easy to do TDD and/or BDD;</p></li>
<li><p>Support asynchronous, non-blocking handling of requests;</p></li>
<li><p>Make it easy to build a proper RESTful, hypermedia-driven application and services, including supporting content-type negotiation for all requests, including HTML;</p></li>
<li><p>Be really open and extensible, because if people can write plug-ins and add-ons easily, I don&rsquo;t have to build all that stuff in.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Backbone.js</strong></p>

<p>Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Andrew Westgarth on Wednesday 26th September 2012 at the Robert Gordon University.</p>

<h2>IIS 8.0 Platform for the Future!</h2>

<p>With the release of Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, Internet Information Server (IIS) received a major update and this has continued through IIS 7.5 which was released with Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7. Now we sit on the verge of another update with the upcoming release of Windows Server 8 and Windows 8 which bring with them IIS 8.0.</p>

<p>In this session we&rsquo;ll set the scene with a quick run through of the building blocks put in place through IIS 7 and 7.5 and then deep dive into the features coming in IIS 8.0 which enable Developers and IT pros to deliver optimised, advanced interactive applications using technologies such as HTML5 and Web Sockets whilst also making use of scalability and configuration enhancements on the underlying platform.</p>
