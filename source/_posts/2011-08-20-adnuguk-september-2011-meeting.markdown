Hot on the heels of the announcement of our [August Meeting](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=320), I am pleased to announce our upcoming September Meeting.




This time around we are lucky enough to have [Phil Leggetter](http://www.leggetter.co.uk/) ([@leggetter](http://twitter.com/leggetter)) presenting a talk on the Real-Time Web. You can find the complete details of the talk, and register for it [here](http://adnuguk-sep.eventbrite.com/).




As with the booking of the August Meeting, I am again using [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) to handle the registration of the September Meeting. In addition, I have also used Eventbrite to send out the invitations for the Event. In order to achieve this, I have moved the email addresses of all registered Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group members to a contact list within Eventbrite. If for some reason you would like your email address removed from this contact list, then please do not hesitate to get in contact with [me](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=38).
