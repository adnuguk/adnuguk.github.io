Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present a talk by Gill Cleeren on Tuesday 23rd April 2013 at the Robert Gordon University.




## **Applied MVVM in Windows 8 Apps: not your typical MVVM session!**




For some time now, the community has been touting the MVVM pattern as being the best way to build XAML-based applications. By now, you should be convinced that MVVM is really the way to go. But then, you start building a real-world Windows 8 application and you encounter all kinds of challenges you hadn't thought about before. How do I properly structure an application? How do I implement navigation? How do I manage tiles or contracts from MVVM? How do I use Dependency injection correctly? And how do the new data controls in Windows 8 work in combination with MVVM?




A whole list of questions that this session will aim at answering!
