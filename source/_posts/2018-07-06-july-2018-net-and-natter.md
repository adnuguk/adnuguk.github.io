Aberdeen Developers are pleased to present something a little different for us. Hopefully you’ll be able to join us at Engage Gaming for our first “.NET and Natter”, a catch up and general geek out on all things .NET.

No planned agenda for this meeting so all topics considered, hopefully we can all get involved in the conversation. So, bring along your laptop and show off your latest work, share your experience on that awesome new framework you’ve been working with, sound out those crazy ideas you have with the rest of the group, or just enjoy a beer, a burger and a catch up.
